title: llLoopSoundSlave
description: >-
  Plays attached sound looping at volume (0.0 - 1.0), synced to most audible
  sync master.

  Behaviour is identical to llLoopSound, unless there is a "Sync Master"
  present.

  If a Sync Master is already playing the Slave sound will begin playing from
  the same point the master is in its loop synchronizing the loop points of both
  sounds.

  If a Sync Master is started when the Slave is already playing, the Slave will
  skip to the correct position to sync with the Master.
