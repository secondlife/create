title: llAddToLandBanList
description: >-
  Add avatar ID to the parcel ban list for the specified number of Hours.

  A value of 0 for Hours will add the agent indefinitely.

  The smallest value that Hours will accept is 0.01; anything smaller will be
  seen as 0.

  When values that small are used, it seems the function bans in approximately
  30 second increments (Probably 36 second increments, as 0.01 of an hour is 36
  seconds).

  Residents teleporting to a parcel where they are banned will be redirected to
  a neighbouring parcel.
