title: llRotLookAt
description: >-
  Cause object to rotate to Rotation, with a force function defined by Strength
  and Damping parameters. Good strength values are around half the mass of the
  object and good damping values are less than 1/10th of the strength.

  Asymmetrical shapes require smaller damping.

  A strength of 0.0 cancels the look at.
