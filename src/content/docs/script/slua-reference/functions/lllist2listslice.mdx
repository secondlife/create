title: llList2ListSlice
description: >-
  Returns a subset of entries from ListVariable, in a range specified by Start
  and End indices (inclusive) return the slice_index element of each stride.
   Using negative numbers for Start and/or End causes the index to count backwards from the length of the list. (e.g. 0, -1 captures entire list)
  If slice_index is less than 0, it is counted backwards from the end of the
  stride.
   Stride must be a positive integer > 0 or an empy list is returned.  If slice_index falls outside range of stride, an empty list is returned. slice_index is zero-based. (e.g. A stride of 2 has valid indices 0,1)
