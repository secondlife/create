title: llScaleByFactor
description: >-
  Attempts to resize the entire object by ScalingFactor, maintaining the
  size-position ratios of the prims.


  Resizing is subject to prim scale limits and linkability limits. This function
  can not resize the object if the linkset is physical, a pathfinding character,
  in a keyframed motion, or if resizing would cause the parcel to overflow.

  Returns a boolean (an integer) TRUE if it succeeds, FALSE if it fails.
