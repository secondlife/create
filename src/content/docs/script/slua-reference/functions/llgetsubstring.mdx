title: llGetSubString
description: >-
  Returns a sub-string from String, in a range specified by the Start and End
  indices (inclusive).

  Using negative numbers for Start and/or End causes the index to count
  backwards from the length of the string, so 0, -1 would capture the entire
  string.

  If Start is greater than End, the sub string is the exclusion of the entries.
