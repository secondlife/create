title: llLoopSound
description: >-
  Plays specified Sound, looping indefinitely, at Volume (0.0 - 1.0).

  Only one sound may be attached to an object at a time.

  A second call to llLoopSound with the same key will not restart the sound, but
  the new volume will be used. This allows control over the volume of already
  playing sounds.

  Setting the volume to 0 is not the same as calling llStopSound; a sound with 0
  volume will continue to loop.

  To restart the sound from the beginning, call llStopSound before calling
  llLoopSound again.
