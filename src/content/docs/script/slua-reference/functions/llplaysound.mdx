title: llPlaySound
description: >-
  Plays Sound once, at Volume (0.0 - 1.0) and attached to the object.

  Only one sound may be attached to an object at a time, and attaching a new
  sound or calling llStopSound will stop the previously attached sound.

  A second call to llPlaySound with the same sound will not restart the sound,
  but the new volume will be used, which allows control over the volume of
  already playing sounds.

  To restart the sound from the beginning, call llStopSound before calling
  llPlaySound again.
