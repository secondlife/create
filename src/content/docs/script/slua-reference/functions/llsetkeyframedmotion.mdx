title: llSetKeyframedMotion
description: >-
  Requests that a non-physical object be key-framed according to key-frame list.

  Specify a list of times, positions, and orientations to be followed by an
  object. The object will be smoothly moved between key-frames by the simulator.
  Collisions with other non-physical or key-framed objects will be ignored (no
  script events will fire and collision processing will not occur). Collisions
  with physical objects will be computed and reported, but the key-framed object
  will be unaffected by those collisions.

  Keyframes is a strided list containing positional, rotational, and time data
  for each step in the motion.  Options is a list containing optional arguments
  and parameters (specified by KFM_* constants).
