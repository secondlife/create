title: llSensor
description: >-
  Performs a single scan for Name and ID with Type (AGENT, ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
  and/or SCRIPTED) within Range meters and Arc radians of forward vector.

  Specifying a blank Name, 0 Type, or NULL_KEY ID will prevent filtering results
  based on that parameter. A range of 0.0 does not perform a scan.

  Results are returned in the sensor and no_sensor events.
