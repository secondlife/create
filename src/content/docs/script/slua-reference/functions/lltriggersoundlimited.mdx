title: llTriggerSoundLimited
description: >-
  Plays Sound at Volume (0.0 - 1.0), centered at but not attached to object,
  limited to axis-aligned bounding box defined by vectors top-north-east (TNE)
  and bottom-south-west (BSW).

  There is no limit to the number of triggered sounds which can be generated by
  an object, and calling llTriggerSound does not affect the attached sounds
  created by llPlaySound and llLoopSound. This is very useful for things like
  collision noises, explosions, etc. There is no way to stop or alter the volume
  of a sound triggered by this function.
