title: llList2List
description: >-
  Returns a subset of entries from ListVariable, in a range specified by the
  Start and End indicies (inclusive).

  Using negative numbers for Start and/or End causes the index to count
  backwards from the length of the string, so 0, -1 would capture the entire
  string.

  If Start is greater than End, the sub string is the exclusion of the entries.
