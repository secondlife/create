title: llDeleteSubList
description: >-
  Removes the slice from start to end and returns the remainder of the list.

  Remove a slice from the list and return the remainder, start and end are
  inclusive.

  Using negative numbers for start and/or end causes the index to count
  backwards from the length of the list, so 0, -1 would delete the entire list.

  If Start is larger than End the list deleted is the exclusion of the entries;
  so 6, 4 would delete the entire list except for the 5th list entry.
