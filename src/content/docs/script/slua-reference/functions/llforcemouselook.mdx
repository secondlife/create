title: llForceMouselook
description: >-
  If Enable is TRUE any avatar that sits on this object is forced into
  mouse-look mode.

  After calling this function with Enable set to TRUE, any agent sitting down on
  the prim will be forced into mouse-look.

  Just like llSitTarget, this changes a permanent property of the prim (not the
  object) and needs to be reset by calling this function with Enable set to
  FALSE in order to disable it.
