title: llLoopSoundMaster
description: >-
  Plays attached Sound, looping at volume (0.0 - 1.0), and declares it a sync
  master.

  Behaviour is identical to llLoopSound, with the addition of marking the source
  as a "Sync Master", causing "Slave" sounds to sync to it. If there are
  multiple masters within a viewers interest area, the most audible one (a
  function of both distance and volume) will win out as the master.

  The use of multiple masters within a small area is unlikely to produce the
  desired effect.
