title: llDeleteSubString
description: >-
  Removes the indicated sub-string and returns the result.

  Start and End are inclusive.

  Using negative numbers for Start and/or End causes the index to count
  backwards from the length of the string, so 0, -1 would delete the entire
  string.

  If Start is larger than End, the sub-string is the exclusion of the entries;
  so 6, 4 would delete the entire string except for the 5th character.
