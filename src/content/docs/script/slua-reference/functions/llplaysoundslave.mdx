title: llPlaySoundSlave
description: >-
  Plays attached Sound once, at Volume (0.0 - 1.0), synced to next loop of most
  audible sync master.

  Behaviour is identical to llPlaySound, unless there is a "Sync Master"
  present. If a Sync Master is already playing, the Slave sound will not be
  played until the Master hits its loop point and returns to the beginning.

  llPlaySoundSlave will play the sound exactly once; if it is desired to have
  the sound play every time the Master loops, either use llLoopSoundSlave with
  extra silence padded on the end of the sound or ensure that llPlaySoundSlave
  is called at least once per loop of the Master.
