title: llVolumeDetect
description: >-
  If DetectEnabled = TRUE, object becomes phantom but triggers collision_start
  and collision_end events when other objects start and stop interpenetrating.

  If another object (including avatars) interpenetrates it, it will get a
  collision_start event.

  When an object stops interpenetrating, a collision_end event is generated.
  While the other is inter-penetrating, collision events are NOT generated.
