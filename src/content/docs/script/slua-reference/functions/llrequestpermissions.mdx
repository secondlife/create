title: llRequestPermissions
description: >-
  Ask AvatarID to allow the script to perform certain actions, specified in the
  PermissionMask bitmask. PermissionMask should be one or more PERMISSION_*
  constants. Multiple permissions can be requested simultaneously by ORing the
  constants together. Many of the permissions requests can only go to object
  owner.

  This call will not stop script execution. If the avatar grants the requested
  permissions, the run_time_permissions event will be called.
