title: llGenerateKey
description: >-
  Generates a key (SHA-1 hash) using UUID generation to create a unique key.

  As the UUID produced is versioned, it should never return a value of NULL_KEY.

  The specific UUID version is an implementation detail that has changed in the
  past and may change again in the future. Do not depend upon the UUID that is
  returned to be version 5 SHA-1 hash.
