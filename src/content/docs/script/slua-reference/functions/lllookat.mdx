title: llLookAt
description: >-
  Cause object name to point its forward axis towards Target, at a force
  controlled by Strength and Damping.

  Good Strength values are around half the mass of the object and good Damping
  values are less than 1/10th of the Strength.

  Asymmetrical shapes require smaller Damping. A Strength of 0.0 cancels the
  look at.
