title: llGetMass
description: >-
  Returns the mass of object that the script is attached to.

  Returns the scripted object's mass. When called from a script in a link-set,
  the parent will return the sum of the link-set weights, while a child will
  return just its own mass. When called from a script inside an attachment, this
  function will return the mass of the avatar it's attached to, not its own.
