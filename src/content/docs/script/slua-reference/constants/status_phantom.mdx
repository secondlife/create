title: STATUS_PHANTOM
description: >-
  Controls/indicates whether the object collides or not.

  Setting the value to TRUE makes the object non-colliding with all objects. It
  is a good idea to use this for most objects that move or rotate, but are
  non-physical. It is also useful for simulating volumetric lighting. The
  default is FALSE.
