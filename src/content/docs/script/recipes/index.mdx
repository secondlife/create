Looking for working code examples? This collection of recipes shows you how to accomplish common scripting tasks in Second Life. Each recipe includes examples in both LSL and SLua.

## How to Use These Recipes

Each recipe demonstrates a complete, working solution to a specific problem. You can:

- Copy and paste the code directly into your scripts
- Modify the examples to fit your specific needs
- Learn patterns and techniques to apply elsewhere
- Compare LSL and SLua approaches side-by-side
