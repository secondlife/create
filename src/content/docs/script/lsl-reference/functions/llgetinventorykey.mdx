- If the item does not have copy, modify, and transfer permissions, the return is `NULL_KEY`
- Inventory items are records that usually *point* to assets, but they are not the actual assets
- Multiple inventory items can point to the same asset and return the same key
- Some newly created inventory entries get default keys until they are edited and saved:
  - Newly created notecard entries use `NULL_KEY` until they are edited and saved
  - Newly created script entries point to the "Hello Avatar" script until they are edited and saved
  - Most other inventory entries are given unique asset keys at creation time, but this relies on client cooperation
- When an asset is "edited" a new asset key is assigned. The inventory item used to open the asset is updated with the new key, but other inventory items sharing the original asset are NOT updated

## Notes

- The UUID returned is that of the asset to which the inventory item points, not the UUID of the inventory item itself
- Assets are immutable (never changed, only created and deleted), allowing multiple inventory items to refer to the same asset without duplication
- When an asset appears to be modified, it is actually saved as a new asset
- Multiple copies of items in inventory all share the same asset UUID
- To verify inventory item existence, use `llGetInventoryType` instead of checking for `NULL_KEY`
- It is possible to inspect the UUID of any animation in inventory by triggering it and using `llGetAnimationList`:
  ```lsl
  llStartAnimation("myAnim");
  llOwnerSay("myAnim's UUID is " + llList2String(llGetAnimationList(llGetPermissionsKey()), -1));
  ```

## Examples

### Get texture UUID from inventory

```lsl
// Put this script in an empty prim, and drag a full-perm texture into the prim's contents to find out its UUID
default
{
    changed(integer change)
    {
        if (change & CHANGED_INVENTORY)    // if there has been a change to the prim's contents ...
        {
            string name = llGetInventoryName(INVENTORY_TEXTURE, 0);
            if (name)        // if a texture exists ...
            {
                key uuid = llGetInventoryKey(name);
                if (uuid)    // if the uuid is valid ...
                    llOwnerSay( "The UUID of '" + name + "' is " + (string) uuid);
                else         // texture was not full-perm
                    llOwnerSay( "The UUID of '" + name + "' could not be determined");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Get inventory item information

```lsl
string item = "Default";

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llOwnerSay("Touch to get information about \"" + item + "\".");
    }

    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        integer type = llGetInventoryType(item);
        integer index = llListFindList([ INVENTORY_NONE,
            INVENTORY_TEXTURE, INVENTORY_SOUND, INVENTORY_LANDMARK, INVENTORY_CLOTHING,
            INVENTORY_OBJECT, INVENTORY_NOTECARD, INVENTORY_SCRIPT, INVENTORY_BODYPART,
            INVENTORY_ANIMATION, INVENTORY_GESTURE], [type]);
        string name = llList2String(["does not exist",
            "texture", "sound", "landmark", "clothing",
            "object", "notecard", "script", "body part",
            "animation", "gesture"], index);

        llOwnerSay("Type: " + name);

        if(type == INVENTORY_NONE)
            return;

        integer owner_perms = llGetInventoryPermMask(item, MASK_OWNER);
        list perms;
        if(owner_perms & PERM_COPY)
            perms += "Copy";

        if(owner_perms & PERM_MODIFY)
            perms += "Modify";

        if(owner_perms & PERM_TRANSFER)
            perms += "Transfer";

        if(owner_perms & PERM_MOVE)
            perms += "Move";

        llOwnerSay("Perms: " + llList2CSV(perms));

        integer temp = PERM_COPY | PERM_MODIFY | PERM_TRANSFER;
        if((owner_perms & temp) != temp)
            return;

        llOwnerSay("Key: " + (string)llGetInventoryKey(item));
    }
}
```
