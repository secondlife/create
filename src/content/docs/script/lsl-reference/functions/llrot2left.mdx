Mathematically equivalent to:

```lsl
ret = llVecNorm(<0., 1., 0.> * q);
```

If the rotation is known to be a unit quaternion (which object and agent rotations always are), it can be simplified as:

```lsl
ret = <0., 1., 0.> * q;
```

For performance-critical code, direct vector multiplication can be 25-30% faster than calling llRot2Left(). If the operation is done often and at extremely fast rates, it can be advantageous to even save `<0., 1., 0.>` to a local or global variable and reuse it.

## Examples

Move an object 5 metres forward along its own y-axis (left direction), regardless of the object's orientation in the world. Works for both root and child prims:

```lsl
default {
    touch_start(integer total_number) {
        vector v = llRot2Left(llGetLocalRot());
        llSetPos(llGetLocalPos() + v * 5);
    }
}
```

## Notes

This function can be useful to identify the orientation of the local sagittal plane of the prim, since its y-axis is always perpendicular to this local sagittal plane.
