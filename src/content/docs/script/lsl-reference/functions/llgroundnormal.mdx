This function is defined as:

```lsl
vector llGroundNormal(vector offset)
{
    vector slope = llGroundSlope(offset);
    return <slope.x, slope.y, 1.0>;
}
```

## Notes

There is sometimes confusion between a [Surface Normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_%28geometry%29) (the direction from the surface) and a [Normalized Vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector) (a vector with a magnitude of 1.0, also called a Unit Vector). This function does **not** return a unit vector. Surface normals may encode additional information in the magnitude of the vector. If you need a Unit Vector, simply use `llVecNorm`.
