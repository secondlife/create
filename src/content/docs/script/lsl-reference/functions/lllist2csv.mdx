This function's functionality is equivalent to `llDumpList2String(src, ", ")`. The result is more or less CSV format, but it does not conform in all its details.

## Examples

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        list my_list = [FALSE, PI, "a string", ZERO_VECTOR, ZERO_ROTATION, NULL_KEY];
        llOwnerSay(llList2CSV(my_list));
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- `llCSV2List` will not reverse the process if there are commas or oddly matched angle brackets (`<` and `>`) in any of the original strings. For details see the article on `llCSV2List`.
- One way around this is to first use `llEscapeURL` on any user-supplied strings before adding them to the list. `llUnescapeURL` will reverse `llEscapeURL`.
- If your strings may contain commas but not unmatched angle brackets, you can wrap your strings with angle brackets (< and >) like you would use double quotes around the string and then use `llGetSubString` with START at 1 and END at -2 to remove them.

## Notes

- Values are separated with a comma and a space (", ").
- To reverse the process, use `llCSV2List` (see Caveats section).
