title: llOwnerSay
description: >-
  says Text to owner only (if owner is in region).

  Says Text to the owner of the object running the script, if the owner has been
  within the object's simulator since logging into Second Life, regardless of
  where they may be in-world.

## Caveats

- If the message is longer than 1024 bytes, it will be truncated to 1024 bytes. This can convey 1024 ASCII characters, or fewer if non-ASCII characters are present.
- Silently fails approximately 45 seconds after the owner leaves the region the object is in.
- Silently fails when the object to which the script is attached is deeded to a group.
- Some viewers do not display `llOwnerSay` text when the message is empty (empty string).
- Produces swirly particle effects visible only to the owner (who sees the message); these effects do not appear to other avatars.

## Robust Alternative

For better reliability when the owner may not be in the region or the object is group-owned, consider this helper function:

```lsl
uOwnerSayPlus(string inputString)
{
    key owner = llGetOwner();

    // single owner that the region still has a handle for
    if (llKey2Name(owner))
    {
        llOwnerSay(inputString);
    }
    // group owned, must send the message publicly
    else if (llList2Key(llGetObjectDetails(llGetKey(), [OBJECT_GROUP]), 0) == owner)
    {
        llWhisper(0, "/me : " + inputString);
    }
    // single owner, not present, send them an IM
    else
    {
        llInstantMessage(owner, inputString);
    }
}
```

This helper prevents silent failures by:
- Using `llOwnerSay` if the owner is present in the region
- Using `llWhisper` with an emote prefix for group-owned objects
- Using `llInstantMessage` to reach the owner if they're offline or in a different region
