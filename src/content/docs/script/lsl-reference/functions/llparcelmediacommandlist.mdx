## Caveats

- This script's object must be owned by the landowner or the function will silently fail.
- If the script's object is over group owned land, then the object must be deeded to **that** group.
- If the PARCEL_MEDIA_COMMAND_URL value is greater than 254 characters, the command will silently fail.
- If using PARCEL_MEDIA_COMMAND_URL and PARCEL_MEDIA_COMMAND_AGENT, make sure the *Media URL* in the *About Land ...* dialog is unset.
