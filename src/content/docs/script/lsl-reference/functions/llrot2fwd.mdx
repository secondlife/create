This function computes the orientation of the local x-axis (front-direction of prim) relative to the parent (the root prim or the world). It returns the forward vector defined by the rotation - a unit vector pointing in the local positive X direction.

## Technical Details

Mathematically equivalent to:

```lsl
ret = llVecNorm(<1., 0., 0.> * q);
```

If `q` is known to be a unit quaternion, it can be simplified as:

```lsl
ret = <1., 0., 0.> * q;
```

Keep in mind that object and agent rotations will always be unit quaternions.

## Performance Optimization

For repeated operations, direct quaternion multiplication can be significantly faster than calling this function. For example, `<1.0, 0.0, 0.0>*llGetRot()` is about 25-30% faster than `llRot2Fwd(llGetRot())` depending on the VM used. If done often and at extremely fast rates, it can be advantageous to even save `<1.0, 0.0, 0.0>` to a local or global variable and reuse it.

## Examples

Move an object 5 metres forwards along its x-axis when touched, regardless of the object's orientation in world. Works for both root and child prims:

```lsl
default
{
    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        vector v = llRot2Fwd( llGetLocalRot() );
        llSetPos( llGetLocalPos() + v * 5 );
    }
}
```

## Notes

This function can be useful to identify the orientation of the local frontal-plane of the prim, since its x-axis is always perpendicular to this local frontal plane.
