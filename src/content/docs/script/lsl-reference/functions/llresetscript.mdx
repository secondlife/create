        llResetScript();
    }

    changed(integer change)
    {
        // reset script when the owner or the inventory changed
        if (change & (CHANGED_OWNER | CHANGED_INVENTORY))
            llResetScript();

## Notes

When a script is reset:

- A full object update is sent to viewers
- The current event/function is exited without further execution or return
- Any granted URLs are released
- All global variables are set to their defaults
- Timers (including repeating sensors) are cleared
- Listeners are removed
- The event queue is cleared
- The default state is set as the active state
  - If it has a `state_entry` event, then it is queued
