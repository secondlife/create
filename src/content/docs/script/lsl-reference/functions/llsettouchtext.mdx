## Caveats

- The text will only be displayed if set by a script calling this function in the root prim. If text is set by a script in a child prim, it will only display after unlinking or relinking as the root. If either a child or root prim is selected individually and right-clicked, the default "Touch" text will display even if a script in the root has set custom text. The text property will always be that of the root prim unless right-clicking a prim under individual edit mode, in which case the default text always appears.
- Like particles and other set text functions, all text set via llSetTouchText becomes a property of the prim, not the script. The text will remain if the script that set it is deactivated or removed.
- You have no control over the face, size, or color of the displayed text.
- Text is limited to 9 characters (UTF-8 character set may result in fewer than 9 displayed characters).
- To restore the default "Touch" value, use an empty string for text.
- To make it appear as if there is no text, use whitespace characters for text.
