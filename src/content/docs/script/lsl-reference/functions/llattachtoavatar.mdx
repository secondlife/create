        // The attach event is called on both attach and detach, but 'id' is only valid on attach

```

## Caveats

- Attach points can be occupied by multiple attachments. This was not always the case; previously if an attach point was occupied, the existing object was detached and the new attachment took its place.
- Objects attached to the head (and any attachment position within the head) will not be visible in First Person view (Mouselook) if "show attachments in mouselook" is disabled.
- If the attach point is zero but the object was never previously attached, it defaults to the right hand (ATTACH_RHAND).
- If the object is already attached, the function fails silently, regardless of whether the attach point is different from its current attach point.

## Notes

- If the attach point is zero, the object attaches to the attach point it was most recently attached to.
- The attach event fires on both attachment and detachment; the avatar key is only valid during attachment.
