- An environment set locally on the viewer will override any environment set from this function.
- When changing a parcel's environment it must first have had an environment set.
- If the parcel is group-owned, the script must either be deeded to the group, or the script owner must have "Modify environment settings and day cycle" group ability **and** have an active agent in the sim.

## Notes

The owner of the script must have permission to modify the environment on the parcel or be an estate manager to change the entire region.

An override for a given parameter can be set at the region scope or parcel scope. It can also be set for a single sky track, all sky tracks, or both. If an override of a given parameter is specified for both an individual track and all tracks, the individual track's override takes priority.

### Position Parameter Details

- Use `<-1, -1, z>` for the entire region
- The z-component specifies which sky track to change, based on elevation
- Use `z=-1` to set an override on the special 'all tracks' slot

### Return Values

- `1` - The parcel or region will attempt to change the applied environment
- `ENV_NO_ENVIRONMENT` (-3) - There is no environment on this parcel to modify
- `ENV_INVALID_RULE` (-5) - There was an issue with one of the rules
- `ENV_VALIDATION_FAIL` (-6) - Unable to validate values passed
- `ENV_THROTTLE` (-8) - The scripts have exceeded the throttle. Wait and retry the request
- `ENV_NO_PERMISSIONS` (-9) - The script does not have rights to modify this parcel or region

### Parameters

Passing an empty list will remove any modifications from previous calls to llSetEnvironment.

Note that the list of valid parameters differs from those available for llGetEnvironment.
