The `Scope` parameter uses the following flags to determine which objects to return:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `OBJECT_RETURN_PARCEL` | Return all objects on the same parcel as the script which are owned by `owner`. The script must be owned by an estate manager or over a parcel owned by the owner of the script. |
| `OBJECT_RETURN_PARCEL_OWNER` | Return all objects owned by `owner` which are over parcels owned by the owner of the script. |
| `OBJECT_RETURN_REGION` | Return all objects in the region owned by `owner`. The script must be owned by the estate owner or an estate manager. |

## Caveats

- Parcel owner, estate owner and estate managers cannot have their objects returned by this method
- Objects which are owned by the group the land is set to will not be returned by this method
- Objects owned by other groups will be returned to their previous owner if the object is transferable; if not transferable they are deleted
- For group-owned land you may want to explicitly code a group owner's key into the script as there is no way to determine if a user is a group owner

## Throttling

This function is throttled at max parcel land impact capacity region-wide per hour.

## Return Value

Returns the number of objects successfully returned to their owners, or an `ERR_*` error flag (negative values indicate errors).
