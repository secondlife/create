Stop the script at the end of the current time slice, until re-enabled:

```lsl
//Stops the Script, at some non-deterministic time later, until invoked with TRUE, in another script
llSetScriptState(llGetScriptName(), FALSE);
// Stall until end of time slice
llSleep(0.1);
```

Start another script:

```lsl
//Starts Another Script
llSetScriptState("somescript", TRUE);
```

## Caveats

- Cannot be used to restart a script that has encountered a runtime error.
- Cannot be used to start a script that has been added via `llGiveInventory`. Scripts sent via `llRemoteLoadScriptPin`, and which have the running state set FALSE by that command, may be started.
- The script appears to stop when its time slice ends, not sooner. If a script tries to stop itself then some LSL code following the `llSetScriptState` call may be executed before the script stops.
- If a script is paused by `llSetScriptState` and is then either re-rezzed, in a region during a restart, or moved into a different region, the script's memory is reset.
