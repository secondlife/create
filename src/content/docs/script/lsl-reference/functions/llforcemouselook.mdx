title: llForceMouselook
description: >-
  If Enable is TRUE any avatar that sits on this object is forced into
  mouse-look mode.

  After calling this function with Enable set to TRUE, any agent sitting down on
  the prim will be forced into mouse-look.

  Just like llSitTarget, this changes a permanent property of the prim (not the
  object) and needs to be reset by calling this function with Enable set to
  FALSE in order to disable it.

```lsl
default {
    state_entry() {
        llForceMouselook(TRUE); // Forces sitting avatars into mouselook.

        llForceMouselook(FALSE); // Reverts the setting to the default...
                                 // ...as with a newly created prim.
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- This function has no effect on avatars already seated.
- The user may exit mouselook mode at any time.
  - This can be detected by polling `llGetAgentInfo`.
- There is nothing stopping someone from modifying or making a client that ignores this.

## Notes

- A sit target is not necessary for this function to work.
