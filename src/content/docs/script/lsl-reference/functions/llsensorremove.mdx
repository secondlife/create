The following example shows an object that when touched starts scanning for avatars in 10m every 30 seconds. When an avatar is detected, it displays their name and stops the sensor.

```lsl
default {
    touch_start(integer x) {
        llSensorRepeat("", NULL_KEY, AGENT, 10.0, PI, 30.0);
    }

    sensor(integer x) {
        llSay(0, llDetectedName(0) + " was found first!");
        llSensorRemove();
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- If called within the `sensor` event, `llSensorRemove()` also removes all of the sensor data that is accessed by the detection functions (such as `llDetectedName()`, `llDetectedPos()`, etc.). This means you should retrieve any needed detection data before calling this function within the sensor event handler.
