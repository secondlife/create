- Since this function requests the client to perform a task, there is no way for script to know if it has failed.

## Options

The `Options` parameter accepts the following list entries:

| Option | Parameters | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `BEACON_MAP` | `[integer open_map, integer focus_map]` | Requests viewer world map behavior. If the first parameter is `TRUE` the viewer should open the world map. If the second parameter is `TRUE` this function also requests that the map should receive focus. Setting both values to true mimics the behavior of `llMapDestination`. Note that the focus_map parameter is only meaningful if open_map is `TRUE`. |

## Examples

The following example mimics the behavior of `llMapDestination`:

```lsl
default
{
    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        llMapBeacon("WindSong", <185,140,29>, [BEACON_MAP, TRUE, TRUE]);
    }
}
```

## Notes

- The `Position` parameter will work with region coordinates not inside the specified region name (like those returned by `llRequestInventoryData`).
- If called from non-touch events, it only works for the owner.
- If called from touch events, it may only work for the first or last touch in the event queue (when `num_touched > 1`).
- If called inside an attachment, it only works for the owner.
