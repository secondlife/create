title: llTargetedEmail
description: Sends an email with Subject and Message to the owner or creator of an object.

The message is automatically prefixed with object and location information:

```
Object-Name: *prim*
Region: *simname* (*simpos.x*, *simpos.y*)
Local-Position: (*primpos.x*, *primpos.y*, *primpos.z*)

*message*
```

Example output:
```
Object-Name: Object
Region: Gibson (254976, 256000)
Local-Position: (117, 129, 50)

The real message starts here.
```

## Examples

```lsl
string emailSubject = "Someone touched me!";

default
{
    touch_start(integer num_detected)
    {
        // llSay(PUBLIC_CHANNEL, "Sending eMail report now, this will take ~20 seconds.");

        key id = llDetectedKey(0);
        string name = llDetectedName(0);

        llTargetedEmail(TARGETED_EMAIL_OBJECT_OWNER, emailSubject,
            "I was touched by: '" + name + "' (" + (string)id + ").");

        // llSay(PUBLIC_CHANNEL, "Email has been sent.");
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- Originally this function was intended to enable sending email to either the object owner or creator; however, the ability to email creators was removed to avoid abuse scenarios.
- There is a limit to the number of email messages an object can send in a given amount of time.
- There is a limit of 500 messages from a single agent's objects in a one hour period.
- The 4096 byte size limit includes the subject line and automatically added text. The practical maximum body size is approximately 3600 bytes.
- Email throttling is applied per user when the destination is outside of Second Life. Messages within the same region bypass region-level throttling (beyond the 20-second delay), and messages between different sims are not throttled beyond the 20-second delay.
- Due to bug SVC-23 (present since 2005), objects may stop receiving emails completely until either the region is restarted or the object crosses a region boundary. Emails sent may eventually be received after a restart/region-cross. Don't rely on this function for reliable inter-region messaging.
- Due to bug SVC-391, llEmail will silently fail (no mail will arrive) when non-ASCII characters are present in the subject. Non-ASCII characters in the message body will be replaced by "?".
