### Basic Usage

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSetSitText("Be Seated");
    }
}
```

### Removing Sit Text

There is no way to stop a pie menu from having a "Sit Here" space reserved on it. Although by setting the string to a space no text will be shown.

To remove custom text that you have placed there, set the text as an empty string like this: `""`.

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSetSitText("");
    }
}
```

Upon your having done so, the text that appears will revert to "Sit Here."

## Caveats

- **Text** will only be displayed if set by a script calling this function in the root. If **text** is set by a script in a child the **text** will only be displayed after unlinking it or relinking it as the root. If either a child or the root is selected as an individual prim and right clicked, the **text** displayed will be the default even if a script in the root has set **text**. More simply - The **text** property displayed on right click will always be that of the root unless, right clicking a prim under individual edit when it will always be the LL default.
- Note that like particles, and the other set text functions, all **text** set via llSetSitText becomes a property of a prim, not a script. For that reason, the **text** will remain if the script that set it is deactivated or even removed.
- You have no control over the face, size or colour of the displayed **text**.
- **Text** is limited to 9 characters.
