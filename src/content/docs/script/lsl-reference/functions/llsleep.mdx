The script will sleep at least until the next server-frame, which happen every (1/45 = ~0.02222) seconds under normal conditions.

If `sec` is zero or less, the script will not sleep at all.

## Examples

### Basic Sleep Example

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSay(0, "I going to take a nap for 5 seconds.");
        llSleep(5.0);
        llSay(0, "I feel so refreshed!");
    }
}
```

### Measuring Sleep Duration

This example demonstrates the actual sleep duration between iterations:

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llOwnerSay("Time between sleeps:");

        integer loops = 10;
        float last_time = 0.0;

        llResetTime();
        llSleep(0.02);

        while (--loops)
        {
            float time = llGetTime();
            llOwnerSay((string)(time - last_time));
            last_time = time;
            llSleep(0.0); // Try a value above zero
        }
    }
}
```

## Notes

- The actual sleep duration may be longer than requested due to server-frame timing constraints
- Sleeping with a value of 0.0 or less does not suspend execution
- During sleep, the script will not process any events or execute any code
