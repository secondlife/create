This example demonstrates preloading a sound when the object is rezzed, then playing it when touched:

```lsl
string sound = "name or uuid"; // sound in inventory or UUID of a sound

default
{
    on_rez(integer start_param)
    {
        llSetText("Preloading....", <1, 0, 0>, 1);
        llPreloadSound(sound);
        llSetText("Touch To Play", <1, 1, 1>, 1);
    }

    touch_start(integer num_detected)
    {
        llPlaySound(sound, 1.0);
    }
}
```

This pattern is useful for ensuring sounds are loaded on nearby viewers before they're needed, reducing startup delays when `llPlaySound` is called.

## Notes

This function is intended to prevent delays in starting new sounds. The preloading affects viewers within range of the object.
