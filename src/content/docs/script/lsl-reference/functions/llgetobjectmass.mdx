- Returns zero if `id` is not found in the region
- `id` can be any prim in the object

## Examples

```lsl
default {
    touch(integer n) {
        llSay(0, llDetectedName(0) + " your mass is " + (string)llGetObjectMass(llDetectedKey(0)) + " lindogram.");
    }
}
```

## Notes

- Mass in Second Life is expressed as *lindogram*. One lindogram appears to be equal to 100 kilograms.
- Mass for avatars is relative to shape/size and unaffected by attachments. However, avatar masses show less variation than expected relative to shape/size, and the lindogram masses do not appear realistic.
- Sitting avatars add their mass to the object.
- This function returns a mass of 0.01 for child agents.
- Prior to server code version 1.18.6.76747, avatar mass was fixed at 1.954922 lindogram. It is now relative to avatar shape/size.
- This function is a handy way to determine if an object or avatar still exists in a region. Other methods exist (such as checking that OBJECT_OWNER returned by llGetObjectDetails is a valid key), but this has slightly less overhead.
