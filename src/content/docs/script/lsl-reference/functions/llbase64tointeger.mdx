title: llBase64ToInteger
description: >-
  Returns an integer that is the Text, Base64 decoded as a big endian integer.

  Returns zero if Text is longer then 8 characters. If Text contains fewer then
  6 characters, the return value is unpredictable.

```lsl
integer value = llBase64ToInteger("3q0AAA==");

// writes out -559087616
llOwnerSay((string)value);

## Caveats

- If the input string contains fewer than 6 characters, any incomplete least-significant bytes of the integer are set to 0.
  - For example, the Base64 value `"qqqqqq=="` corresponds to the hexadecimal value `0xAAAAAAAA`. If the padding "=" characters and the last "q" are dropped, there are 5*6=30 bits remaining and those can form only 3 full bytes (24 bits). The result is `0xAAAAAA00`.
  - The Base64 value `"qqqq"` has 4*6=24 bits available, which is enough for the same 3 full bytes. The result is also `0xAAAAAA00`.
  - Similarly, 3-character Base64 has 18 bits, enough for 2 bytes, and 2-character Base64 has 12 bits, enough for one byte.
  - Single-character Base64 has only 6 bits and thus no complete bytes, and the result is always zero.
- Returns zero if the string is longer than 8 characters.
