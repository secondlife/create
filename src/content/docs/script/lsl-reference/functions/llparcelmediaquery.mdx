title: llParcelMediaQuery
description: >-
  Queries the media properties of the parcel containing the script, via one or
  more PARCEL_MEDIA_COMMAND_* arguments specified in CommandList.

  This function will only work if the script is contained within an object owned
  by the land-owner (or if the land is owned by a group, only if the object has
  been deeded to the group).

```lsl
//-- quick function to tell you the URL of the Media the Parcel is set for
default {
  touch_start( integer vIntNull ) { //-- named null because we're ignoring it
    llSay( 0, "The Media URL is\n" + (string)llParcelMediaQuery( (list)PARCEL_MEDIA_COMMAND_URL ) );
  }
}
```

## Caveats

- This script's object must be owned by the landowner or the function will silently fail.
- If the script's object is over group owned land, then the object must be deeded to **that** group.
