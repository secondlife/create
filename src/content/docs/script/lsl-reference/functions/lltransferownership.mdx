Transfers ownership of an object rezzed in world to the specified agent. The object must be transferable by its current owner and must not be an attachment.

Optionally this function may force the object to derez itself into the destination agent's inventory, or make a copy of itself directly into inventory.

## Examples

```lsl
default
{
    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        llTransferOwnership(llDetectedKey(0), TRANSFER_FLAG_COPY, []);
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- The agent must be in the region
- There is no way to detect if the receiver ignored, rejected or blocked the transaction (aside from a `changed` event never occurring)
- The function fails with a return code of `TRANSFER_NO_PERMS` if:
  - The object is no-transfer
  - The object is no-copy and the flags include the `TRANSFER_FLAG_COPY` flag
- Calling this function from an attachment will fail and return `TRANSFER_NO_ATTACHMENT`
- **WARNING:** Any no-trans items in the transferred object will be removed from the object received by the target agent. If the transfer is of the object itself, these items are lost.
- **WARNING:** If the transfer is a copy, any no-copy inventory items will be present in the object received by the target agent and removed from the original.
