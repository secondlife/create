title: llDeleteSubList
description: >-
  Removes the slice from start to end and returns the remainder of the list.

  Remove a slice from the list and return the remainder, start and end are
  inclusive.

  Using negative numbers for start and/or end causes the index to count
  backwards from the length of the list, so 0, -1 would delete the entire list.

  If Start is larger than End the list deleted is the exclusion of the entries;
  so 6, 4 would delete the entire list except for the 5th list entry.

### Basic Usage

```lsl
src = llDeleteSubList( src, start, end )
```

### Comprehensive Example

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        // Create a list of names
        list names = ["Anthony", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diane", "Edgar", "Gabriela"];

        // Now let's remove values at position 1 through 2.
        names = llDeleteSubList(names, 1, 2);

        // Result:
        // list names = ["Anthony", "Diane", "Edgar", "Gabriela"];

        // Now let's use an start number higher then our end number
        names = llDeleteSubList(names, 3, 1);

        // Result:
        // list names = ["Edgar"];
        // If start number higher then our end number, then we should imagine that the start and the end are missing before start and end.
        // Imagine it should be FROM_THE_LISTSTART_CUT: start, AND_FROM_THE_LISTEND_CUT: end ... more or less :))
        // names = llDeleteSubList(names, 3 -> , <- 1);
    }
}
```

## Notes

- The function returns a modified copy of the source list; the original `src` list is not modified. Remember to use or store the result of this function.
- When start is larger than end, the list deleted is the exclusion of the entries (inverse selection). For example, `llDeleteSubList(list, 3, 1)` deletes everything except positions 2 and 3.
- The opposite function is `llListInsertList`, which inserts elements rather than removing them.
