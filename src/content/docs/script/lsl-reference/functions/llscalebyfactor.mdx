title: llScaleByFactor
description: >-
  Attempts to resize the entire object by ScalingFactor, maintaining the
  size-position ratios of the prims.


  Resizing is subject to prim scale limits and linkability limits. This function
  can not resize the object if the linkset is physical, a pathfinding character,
  in a keyframed motion, or if resizing would cause the parcel to overflow.

  Returns a boolean (an integer) TRUE if it succeeds, FALSE if it fails.

        float max_factor = llGetMaxScaleFactor();

        llSay(PUBLIC_CHANNEL, "min_scale_factor = " + (string)min_factor
                            + "\nmax_scale_factor = " + (string)max_factor);

        integer success;

        if (growing) success = llScaleByFactor(2.0);
        else         success = llScaleByFactor(0.5);

        if (!success) llSay(PUBLIC_CHANNEL, "Scaling failed!");
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- Due to floating point precision issues (often, sqrt(x*x) != x), avoid rescaling by the values returned by `llGetMinScaleFactor` and `llGetMaxScaleFactor`. To guarantee successful rescaling, use values slightly within the limits returned by those functions.

## Notes

- Resizing is subject to prim scale limits and linkability limits
- The function fails if the linkset is physical, a pathfinding character, in a keyframed motion, or if resizing would cause the parcel to overflow
- The function maintains the size-position ratios of all prims in the linkset
