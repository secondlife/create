title: llTriggerSoundLimited
description: >-
  Plays Sound at Volume (0.0 - 1.0), centered at but not attached to object,
  limited to axis-aligned bounding box defined by vectors top-north-east (TNE)
  and bottom-south-west (BSW).

  There is no limit to the number of triggered sounds which can be generated by
  an object, and calling llTriggerSound does not affect the attached sounds
  created by llPlaySound and llLoopSound. This is very useful for things like
  collision noises, explosions, etc. There is no way to stop or alter the volume
  of a sound triggered by this function.

- Unlike `llSetSoundRadius`, the sound audibility is determined by **avatar** position and not camera position.
- If the script is attached and the parcel has avatar sounds turned off, an error is shouted on DEBUG_CHANNEL: "Too many sound triggers."
- If the object moves the sound does not move with it. Use `llPlaySound` to play a sound attached to the object.

## Examples

### Sound Boundary Helper

This helper script calculates the bounding box coordinates needed for `llTriggerSoundLimited`. Click the prim to generate the function call parameters:

```lsl
/*
    Single Prim llTriggerSoundLimited Helper by Daemonika Nightfire.

    Just use this script in a single prim and make the prim as big as your room.
    If you then click on the prim, the sound will only be triggered inside and you will get a message with a finished LSL code.
    You can simply copy this code to the clipboard and use it in your actual script.

    Important:
    You cannot rotate the prim, the code needs global coordinates.

### Secret Collision Sound

This example plays a sound on collision only to the person who collided with the object. Useful for haunted houses where you want to add confusion—others won't hear the sound!

```lsl
string sound = "a9da4612-5d4b-662a-050a-c821c394991f"; // squeaky toy

playSoundAt(key avatar, string sound, float volume)
{
    if (llGetAgentSize(avatar)) // Make sure theyre actually present
    {
        vector pos = (vector)llList2String(llGetObjectDetails(avatar, [OBJECT_POS]),0); // Their position
        list scale = llGetBoundingBox(avatar); // The corners of their bounding box
        vector corner2 = pos+llList2Vector(scale,1); // Top northeast corner of their bounding box
        vector corner1 = pos+llList2Vector(scale,0); // Bottom southwest corner of their bounding box
        llTriggerSoundLimited(sound, volume, corner2, corner1); // Play sound in their location only
    }
}
default
{
    collision_start(integer n)
    {
        key bumper = llDetectedKey(0);
        float volume = 1.0; // Volume is affected by distance like llPlaySound!
        playSoundAt(bumper, sound, volume);
    }
}
```
