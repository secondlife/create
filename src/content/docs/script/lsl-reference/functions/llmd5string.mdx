**Security Warning:** The MD5 hashing algorithm should not be used because it is too easy to generate collisions (two inputs which result in the same hash). See [CERT Advisory](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/836068).

## Technical Details

The nonce is cast to a string and appended to the source after a colon. The formula is:

```
MD5Hash(src + ":" + nonce)
```

This is important to know if you are calculating a hash in another language and wish to compare with one calculated in LSL.

The character encoding used by llMD5String is UTF-8.

## Examples

```lsl
llSay(0, llMD5String("Hello, Avatar!", 0)); // returns 112abd47ceaae1c05a826828650434a6
```

### Comparison with Linux

You can verify LSL MD5 hashes using the command line:

```bash
$ echo -n 'Hello, Avatar!:0' | openssl md5
112abd47ceaae1c05a826828650434a6
```

Note the nonce is appended after a colon, matching the LSL behavior.
