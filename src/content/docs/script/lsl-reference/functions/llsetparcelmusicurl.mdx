This script changes the music URL based on time of day:

```lsl
// This script changes the music URL based on time of day.

integer night = FALSE;
string nighturl = "http://205.188.215.228:8006";
string dayurl = "http://208.122.59.30:7156";

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSetTimerEvent(10);
    }

    timer()
    {
        vector pos = llGetSunDirection();

        if ((pos.z < -.75) != night)
        {
            night = !night;
            if (night)
            {
                llSetParcelMusicURL(nighturl);
            }
            else
            {
                llSetParcelMusicURL(dayurl);
            }
        }
    }
}
