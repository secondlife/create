title: llDeleteSubString
description: >-
  Removes the indicated sub-string and returns the result.

  Start and End are inclusive.

  Using negative numbers for Start and/or End causes the index to count
  backwards from the length of the string, so 0, -1 would delete the entire
  string.

  If Start is larger than End, the sub-string is the exclusion of the entries;
  so 6, 4 would delete the entire string except for the 5th character.

This function returns a new string; it does not modify the source string in place.

**Incorrect:**
```lsl
string ex = "abcdefghi";
llDeleteSubString(ex, 4, 7); // Result is discarded!
```

**Correct:**
```lsl
string ex = "abcdefghi";
ex = llDeleteSubString(ex, 4, 7); // Result is assigned back
llSay(0, ex); // Would say "abcdi"
```

## Examples

```lsl
//-- Simple example
default {
    state_entry() {
        string ex = "abcdefghi";
        ex = llDeleteSubString(ex, 4, 7);
        llSay(0, ex); // Output: "abcdi"
    }
}
```

```lsl
//-- Using the result inline
default {
    state_entry() {
        string ex = "abcdefghi";
        llSay(0, llDeleteSubString(ex, 4, 7)); // Output: "abcdi"
        // Original string 'ex' remains unchanged
    }
}
```

## Notes

- Indexes start at zero; the first character is at index 0
- Both `start` and `end` positions are **inclusive** (characters at both positions are removed)
- Using `0, 0` deletes only the first character
- Negative indexes count from the end of the string backwards: `-1` is the last character
- Positive and negative indexes can be mixed: `0, -1` deletes the entire string
- If `start` is larger than `end`, the deletion is inverted: characters at `start` and `end` are kept, everything else is removed
- Use `llStringLength()` to determine string length for dynamic index calculations
- Use `llSubStringIndex()` to find a substring's position before deleting it
- For removing all occurrences of a substring, consider using a str_replace function from the Combined Library
