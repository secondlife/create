title: llFindNotecardTextSync
description: >-
  Searches the text of a cached notecard for lines containing the given
  pattern. 
              Returns a list of line numbers and column where a match is found. If the notecard is not in
              the cache it returns a list containing a single entry of NAK. If no matches are found an
              empty list is returned.

Every match in the notecard is represented as a sequence of three integers:

```lsl
[integer row, integer column, integer length]
```

The returned list has a stride of 3. A maximum of 64 matches are returned, resulting in a maximum list length of 192.

## Behavior

- If the notecard is not in the cache, returns a list containing a single `NAK`
- If the notecard does not exist, returns a list containing a single `NAK` and the script will shout an error on `DEBUG_CHANNEL` (but the script continues to run)
- If there is an error in the regular expression, returns an empty list and the script will shout an error on `DEBUG_CHANNEL` (but the script continues to run)
- If no matches are found, an empty list is returned

## Caveats

- If the notecard contains embedded inventory items (such as textures and landmarks), an empty list will be returned, regardless of the search string
- No more than 64 matches are returned
- Notecards are cached into a fixed-size buffer, with the oldest (least-recently read) notecard getting removed first. It is not safe to assume a notecard has been previously cached. Data for a previously cached notecard may be dropped from the cache at any time, especially on a busy server

## Notes

This function uses regular expressions for pattern matching. Refer to the LSL Regular Expressions documentation for pattern syntax and examples.
