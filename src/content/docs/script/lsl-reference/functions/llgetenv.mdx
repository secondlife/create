The following table lists the valid values for the `name` parameter. Remember that `llGetEnv` returns a string, so you may need to cast it to the appropriate type (integer or float) for use in calculations.

## Examples

```lsl

    {
        string version = llGetEnv("sim_version");
        llOwnerSay("Region " + llGetRegionName() + " is running "
                   + llGetEnv("sim_channel") + " version " + version );

        list ver = llParseString2List(version, ["."], []);

        llOwnerSay("Build: " + llList2String(ver, 3));
        llOwnerSay("Build Date: " + llList2String(ver, 2) + "-" + llList2String(ver, 1) + "-20" + llList2String(ver, 0));
    }
}
```

## Notes

- Region idling lowers a region's framerate when no avatars are currently on or looking into the region. Scripts measuring time dilation with llGetRegionTimeDilation may report significant time dilation if the region is idle.
- Always remember to cast the returned string to the appropriate type (integer or float) when using it in calculations.
