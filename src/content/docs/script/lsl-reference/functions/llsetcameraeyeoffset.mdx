- Setting this will not update the cameras of seated avatars; it will only affect avatars that subsequently sit down. The camera settings have to be prepared in advance.
- The offset is locally relative to the object. If you want it relative to the seated avatar (which likely has a custom sit rotation and offset) or the region, you must do the computation yourself.
- `ZERO_VECTOR` offset will cancel any eye offset.
- Camera position set by this function is a **Prim Property**. It will survive the script and it will survive prim taking and prim rezzing.

## Examples

```lsl
// Sit the avatar looking at an arbitrary direction
// Look over the avatar's shoulders from behind once it sits down

back_view(float degrees)
{
    rotation sitRot = llAxisAngle2Rot(<0, 0, 1>, degrees * DEG_TO_RAD);

    llSitTarget(<0, 0, 0.1>, sitRot);

    llSetCameraEyeOffset(<-2, 0, 1> * sitRot);
    llSetCameraAtOffset(<2, 0, 1> * sitRot);
}

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        back_view( 208 );
        llSay(0, "Please sit down");
    }
}
```
