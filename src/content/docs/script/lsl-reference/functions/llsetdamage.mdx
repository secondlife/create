For an avatar to take damage when the object collides with an avatar:

- The object must not be phantom or have volume detect enabled
- The avatar must be on land where "Safe (no damage)" is disabled
  - Note: The object does not need to be on or even partially over damage enabled land
- When these conditions are met, the avatar receives the damage, and the object will die without calling collision events

## Caveats

- Damage is a Prim Property and may be applied even if there is no running script
- If damage is 100.0 or greater, the object will instantly kill even a fully healthy avatar
- If damage is less than zero, the avatar will be healed for the indicated amount
- If a damage-enabled object hits a physics-enabled object that one or more avatars are sitting on, damage will be distributed to all seated avatars

## Examples

### Simple Auto-Killer Bullet

This will instantly "kill" on collision if contact is made with an avatar on damage-enabled land.

```lsl
default
{
    on_rez(integer param) // Becomes active when rezzed.
    {
        llSetDamage(100.0); // Set the damage to maximum.
        llSensor("", "", AGENT, 96.0, PI); // Sweep a 96 meter sphere searching for agents.
    }
    sensor(integer num) // If an agent is detected...
    {
        llSetStatus(STATUS_PHYSICS, TRUE); // Enable physics to allow physical movement.
        llSetTimerEvent(10.0); // Set a 10 second timer.
        llMoveToTarget(llDetectedPos(0), 0.5); // Move to the detected position.
    }
    no_sensor() // If no agents are detected...
    {
        llDie(); // Auto destruct.
    }
    timer() // If we missed our target...
    {
        llDie(); // Auto destruct.
    }
}
```
