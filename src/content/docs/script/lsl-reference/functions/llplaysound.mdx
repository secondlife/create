title: llPlaySound
description: >-
  Plays Sound once, at Volume (0.0 - 1.0) and attached to the object.

  Only one sound may be attached to an object at a time, and attaching a new
  sound or calling llStopSound will stop the previously attached sound.

  A second call to llPlaySound with the same sound will not restart the sound,
  but the new volume will be used, which allows control over the volume of
  already playing sounds.

  To restart the sound from the beginning, call llStopSound before calling
  llPlaySound again.

## Caveats

- A call to `llPlaySound` replaces any other sound, so only one sound can be played at the same time from the same prim (except sounds started with the deprecated `llSound`, which always plays until the end)
- Sound files must be 30 seconds or shorter
- Sounds are always sampled at 44.1KHz, 16-bit (unsigned), mono. Stereo files will have one channel dropped when uploading
- If the object playing the sound is a HUD (Heads Up Display), the sound is only heard by the user the HUD is attached to
  - To play a sound inworld from a HUD, use `llTriggerSound`
- It is impossible to play two or more sounds at the same time and have them start playing at exactly the same time
  - If multiple sound emitters play the same exact sound within range of the viewer at the same time, they are usually not in sync due to latency between the server/client and script execution delays. This can produce echoes, odd resonance, and other strange effects
- When used with `llSetSoundQueueing`, sounds may play more than once. This can be fixed by disabling the sound queue if only a single sound sample is to be played
- Playing sounds is throttled. If the average number of played sounds per second exceeds the limit (22 sounds/s), all sounds from the object are suppressed until the average falls sufficiently
  - The throttle is per object, not per link or per script, so multiple links cannot be used to overcome the throttle
  - When throttled, the following error appears in debug channel: "Too many sound requests. Throttled until average falls."
