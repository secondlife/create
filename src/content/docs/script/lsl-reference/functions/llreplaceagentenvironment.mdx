## Caveats

- The agent's viewer may choose to ignore this command.
- An environment set locally on the viewer will override any environment set from this function.
- If a UUID is passed as the environment parameter and that UUID does not specify an environment setting, the viewer quietly ignores the instruction.

## Notes

- The environment persists until the agent crosses to a new region or this function is called with the NULL_KEY or empty string in the environment parameter.
- The agent must be in the region and must be participating in the experience.
- This function must be executed as part of an experience with a valid experience key.
