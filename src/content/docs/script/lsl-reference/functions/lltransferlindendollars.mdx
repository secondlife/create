## Caveats

- An object cannot pay another object.
- Objects deeded to groups cannot give money (the permission cannot be granted).
- Use is limited to 30 payments in a 30 second interval for all scripts owned by that resident on a region. Sustained overage will produce a script error and halt payments while the rate remains excessive. Historically, faster payments have failed intermittently.
- Once a script has the `PERMISSION_DEBIT` permission it can empty an account of L$.
  - **Fraud & theft are both Terms of Service violations and crimes.** Misuse this function and you risk being banned and legal action. In addition Linden Lab may freeze the accounts of anyone the money is transferred to and restore it to its rightful owners. This may involve retrieving it from third party exchanges and accounts on those exchanges being frozen. The system is not designed to be friendly towards fraud.

## Notes

- The return value is used in a matching `transaction_result` event for the success or failure of the transfer. If the transaction is successful, this key will show in the [transaction history](https://secondlife.com/my/account/transactions.php).
- If you aren't going to use the return value or the resulting `transaction_result` event, consider using `llGiveMoney` instead of this function.
