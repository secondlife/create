Simple usage to retrieve and display the owner's UUID:

```lsl
llOwnerSay( (string)llGetOwner()); // speaks in chat the "key" (UUID code) of the avatar.
llOwnerSay( llKey2Name(llGetOwner())); // speaks in chat the name of the owner if in the sim.
```

Detecting owner changes with the `changed` event:

```lsl
default
{
    changed(integer change)
    {
        if (change & CHANGED_OWNER)
            llResetScript();
    }

    state_entry()
    {
        key owner = llGetOwner();
        llInstantMessage(owner, "Only you can hear me. Isn't that eerie.");
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- When the owner of an object changes, code that depends on this function's return value will not automatically update for the new owner or be automatically re-evaluated. This requires the reregistration of listens and requesting of permissions from the new owner as needed.
- Caching the return value requires manual updates. It's up to the programmer to work around this limitation for any code that caches the owner UUID.
- When the object is deeded to a group, the UUID returned is that of the group.

## Notes

To retrieve the owner's name while the owner is in the region use `llKey2Name`, `llGetUsername`, or `llGetDisplayName`. Use `llRequestAgentData`, `llRequestUsername`, or `llRequestDisplayName` when the owner is not in the region.

### Handling Owner Changes

A common issue is that previously-activated events referring to the owner (like `llListen`) don't automatically change when the owner changes. The most often-seen result is a listen registered to the owner will continue to listen to the **previous** owner rather than the **current** owner. This is not a bug but part of the design.

Detection of owner change can be achieved with:
- The `changed` event with the `CHANGED_OWNER` flag (most reliable)
- Storing the old value and periodically checking if it has changed (e.g., in `on_rez`). Note: this won't detect if the object is sold with "sell original" in-world.

### Re-initializing Owner-Specific Code

For scripts that need to maintain state across ownership transfers, use a helper function to reinitialize owner-specific code:

```lsl
integer listen_handle;

init()
{
    key owner = llGetOwner();
    llListenRemove(listen_handle);
    // PUBLIC_CHANNEL has the integer value 0
    listen_handle = llListen(PUBLIC_CHANNEL, "", owner, "");
    llRequestPermissions(owner, PERMISSION_TRIGGER_ANIMATION);
}

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        init();
        //insert additional startup code here that doesn't need to run each rez/owner change
        //for example, reading settings from a notecard
    }

    on_rez(integer start)
    {
        init();
    }

    changed(integer change)
    {
        if (change & CHANGED_OWNER)
            init();
    }

    run_time_permissions(integer perm)
    {//always use the run_time_permissions event with llRequestPermissions, never assume
        if(perm & PERMISSION_TRIGGER_ANIMATION)
        {
            //setup your animation code here, start your timers, etc.
            llOwnerSay("I have animation permissions");
        }
    }
}
```

### Helper: Checking Owner or Group Members

To determine the owner of an object that might be group-deeded, use this helper function. Setting the `groupAdmin` parameter to `TRUE` means group members should always count as owners, even if the object isn't deeded to that group:

```lsl
integer isOwner(key id, integer groupAdmin) {
    integer result = FALSE;
    {
        key owner = llGetOwner();
        if (id == owner) result = TRUE;
        else { // If object is group owned, avatar need only belong to same group
            integer sameGroup = llSameGroup(id);
            if (groupAdmin) result = sameGroup;
            else {
                key group = (key)((string)llGetObjectDetails(llGetKey(), [OBJECT_GROUP]));
                if (group == owner) result = sameGroup;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```
