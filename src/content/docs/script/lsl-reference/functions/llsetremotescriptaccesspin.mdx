- A prim has only one pin for remotely loading scripts
- By changing the pin, a script can deny other scripts the ability to load scripts into the prim
  - This could result in unintentionally breaking a product's ability to be updated by an upstream creator
  - This can be used to intentionally stop an upstream creator from updating a product
- There is no way to find out whether a script pin has been set by another script in the prim. If the prim contains scripts from other developers, the safe approach is to assume a script pin has been set by an upstream creator
