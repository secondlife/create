The llDamage function triggers a damage event on the targeted task. If any scripts in the target process the `on_damage` event, they will be fired before the damage is applied or distributed.

## Caveats

- Calls are throttled to a rate of ≤10/30sec per recipient. Exceptions are:
  - Recipient is avatar of the attachment
  - Recipient is sitting on the object
- Triggering the damage throttle will shout an error to the debug channel and the script will continue running
- The prim containing the script and the prim receiving the damage must both be in damage enable parcels
- Targeting a seated avatar will redirect damage to the object the avatar is sitting on

### on_damage Event Behavior

The `on_damage` event will NOT be triggered if the source of the damage is either:
- An attachment on the avatar
- An object or vehicle that the avatar is sitting on

`final_damage` will be triggered as normal.

### Damage Throttle Exceptions

The damage throttle is skipped if:
- Damage is negative
- The source is an attachment on the avatar
- The source is an object that the avatar is sitting on
- The source is an object owned by a parcel owner or land group
