```lsl
vector patrol;

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        patrol = llGetPos();
        llCreateCharacter([CHARACTER_MAX_SPEED, 25, CHARACTER_DESIRED_SPEED, 15.0]);
        state awake;
    }
}

state awake
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSay(0, "I am guarding now");
        list points = [patrol + <5,0,0>, patrol - <5,0,0>];
        llPatrolPoints(points, []);
    }

    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        state sleep;
    }
}

state sleep
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSay(0, "Going to sleep");
        llExecCharacterCmd(CHARACTER_CMD_SMOOTH_STOP, []);
    }

    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        patrol = llGetPos();
        //Jump to attention!
        llExecCharacterCmd(CHARACTER_CMD_JUMP, [0.5]);
        state awake;
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates:
- Creating a character with pathing capabilities
- Using `CHARACTER_CMD_SMOOTH_STOP` to stop the character's movement
- Using `CHARACTER_CMD_JUMP` with a height parameter to make the character jump

## Caveats

- If another script in the same object issues `CHARACTER_CMD_STOP` then pathing in all scripts is cancelled.
