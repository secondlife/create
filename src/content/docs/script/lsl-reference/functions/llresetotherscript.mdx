When a script is reset:

- The current event/function is exited without further execution or return
- All global variables are set to their defaults
- The event queue is cleared, and recurring events are stopped
- The default state is set as the active state
- If it has a state_entry event, then it is queued

## Caveats

- If the script is not running, this call has no effect, even after the script is set running again
- The other script must be within the same prim and has to be running
- A script can reset itself with this function (not just other scripts)

## Examples

```lsl
// the other script must be within the same prim and has to be running

default
{
    touch_start(integer num_detected)
    {
        llResetTime();
    }

    touch_end(integer num_detected)
    {
        if (llGetTime() < 3.0)
            llSay(0, "Please click & hold for at least 3.0 seconds.");
        else
            llResetOtherScript("second");
    }
}
```
