- **Security**: It is a terrible idea to tie any security measures to display names; they are not unique and can easily be changed.
- **Data Execution Risk**: Display names can contain quotes and some punctuation. While this is not a problem for LSL, remember to escape strings being passed to command line scripts, SQL queries, etc. See: [XKCD: Exploits of a Mom](http://xkcd.com/327/)
- If the request fails for any reason, there will be no error notice or dataserver event. You may use a timer to check for stale requests.
- If you merely wish to show the agent display name in the viewer window, it may be more straightforward to use Viewer URI Name Space and avoid a dataserver event:

```lsl
llSay(0, "secondlife:///app/agent/" + (string)id + "/displayname");
```

## Examples

```lsl
key owner_key;
key owner_name_query;
string owner_display_name;

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        owner_key = llGetOwner();
        owner_name_query = llRequestDisplayName(owner_key);
    }
    dataserver(key queryid, string data)
    {
        if ( owner_name_query == queryid )
        {
            owner_display_name = data;
            llSay(0, "The display name of the owner of this script : " + owner_display_name );
        }
    }
}
```
