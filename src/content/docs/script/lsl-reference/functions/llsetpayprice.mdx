Simple example hiding the price field and showing only one button with a value of 150:

```lsl
llSetPayPrice(PAY_HIDE, [150, PAY_HIDE, PAY_HIDE, PAY_HIDE])
```

Complete payment processing example with permission checking:

```lsl
integer price = 10;

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSetPayPrice(PAY_HIDE, [PAY_HIDE, PAY_HIDE, PAY_HIDE, PAY_HIDE]);
        llRequestPermissions(llGetOwner(), PERMISSION_DEBIT);
    }
    run_time_permissions(integer perm)
    {
        if(perm & PERMISSION_DEBIT)
            state cash;
    }
}

state cash
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSetPayPrice(price, [price, PAY_HIDE, PAY_HIDE, PAY_HIDE]);
    }
    money(key id, integer amount)
    {
        if(amount != price)
        {
            llGiveMoney(id, amount);
            llInstantMessage(id, "You paid " + (string)amount + ", which is the wrong price, the price is: " + (string)price);
        }
        else
        {
            //insert your give code here.
            llInstantMessage(id, "You paid the right price");
        }
    }
}
```

## Caveats and Important Notes

- **Do not trust this function to limit payment amounts.** Always verify the amount paid in the `money` event is the amount you expected.
- Use only one call to this function across all scripts on an object to prevent confusion about which values are active. You still need to check in the `money` event that the amount is correct.
- This function only works when called from the root prim of an object. Its effect applies to all prims in the object. Calling it from a child prim has no effect.
  - There is a known viewer bug where calls from child prims will **prevent** payment to the object entirely.
- Payment settings persist in the prim even if the script with `llSetPayPrice()` is removed or recompiled.
- **Caution:** Calling this function enables payment on the prim (or the whole object if it's the root prim) for the current state, even if that state has no `money` event.
- Otherwise, the pay option will only appear on prims with a running script that has a `money` event (or on all prims if the root has such a script).
- Money cannot be paid to an attachment; the "Pay" option goes directly to the wearer instead.
- If `quick_pay_buttons` contains a negative value or zero, that button will not be shown. (Exception: zero is allowed for `price` to set the custom text field value in the Pay window.)

## Constants

The quick pay buttons list uses these constants:

- `PAY_HIDE` (-1) - Hides this quick pay button
- `PAY_DEFAULT` (-2) - Uses the default value for this quick pay button

Default quick pay button values are: $1, $5, $10, $20 (in order)
