- The index of the last character is not equal to the string length.
  - Character indexes start at zero (the index of the first character is zero).
- Returns the number of characters - not bytes - in the string.
  - Some functions that accept strings are limited to bytes, not characters.
  - LSL-2 uses UTF-8 strings and Mono uses UTF-16; both support multibyte characters.
  - To get the number of bytes in a string instead, use the example snippet on llStringToBase64 (there is no native LSL function to do this).

## Examples

```lsl
// assumptions:
//    object name: LSLWiki
//    script name: _lslwiki

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        string HowLongAmI = "123";
        integer strlen = llStringLength(HowLongAmI);
        llOwnerSay( "'" + HowLongAmI + "' has " +(string) strlen + " characters.");
        // The owner of object LSLWiki will hear
        // LSLWiki: '123' has 3 characters.
    }
}
```
