```

## Notes

- There is no Linden Library `llToProperCase` function that would return properly capitalized strings. However, user-created functions exist that provide this functionality, such as `ToNormal`.
- The function works for many characters outside the 7-bit ASCII range, especially Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek characters. However, not all characters tagged as "lowercase" in the Unicode specification are converted.
