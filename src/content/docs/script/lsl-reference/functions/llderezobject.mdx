Deletes, or marks temporary, an object that was previously rezzed by this script. The object's root prim must have been previously rezzed from a script within this object. If the object is successfully deleted, this function returns TRUE; if it fails for any reason, it returns FALSE.

## Derez Options

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| DEREZ_DIE | 0 | Immediately delete the object. |
| DEREZ_MAKE_TEMP | 1 | Mark the object as temporary so that the simulator will remove the object at a later time. |
| DEREZ_TO_INVENTORY | 2 | Returns the targeted object to derezzer's inventory and saves its current state. |

## Caveats

- The targeted object's rezzer must be the same as the object hosting this script
- The target must not be an attachment
- The target must be copyable
- The target's owner must be the same as the script's owner
- When marking an object as temporary, the object must not contribute to the navmesh
- When using DEREZ_TO_INVENTORY:
  - The derezzer must not be an attachment
  - The derezzer must be modifiable
  - The object in the derezzer's inventory must still exist
  - The object in the derezzer's inventory must not be a coalesced object
