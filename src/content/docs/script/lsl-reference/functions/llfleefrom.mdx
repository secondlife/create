- Must use `llCreateCharacter` or script won't compile.
- The position to flee from must be near the nav mesh; otherwise, this behavior will fail and trigger `path_update` with `PU_FAILURE_INVALID_GOAL` (0x03).
- If you want to avoid an agent or object, it's much more elegant and less sim resource intensive to use `llEvade` instead.

## Examples

This example tracks an agent's position and continuously updates the flee target:

```lsl
vector last_touched_pos;
key last_touched_key;

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llCreateCharacter([CHARACTER_DESIRED_SPEED, 50.0]);
    }

    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        last_touched_key = llDetectedKey(0);
        last_touched_pos = llDetectedPos(0);
        llFleeFrom(last_touched_pos, 10, []);
        llSetTimerEvent(0.2);
    }

    timer()
    {
        vector last_touched_pos_now = llList2Vector(llGetObjectDetails(last_touched_key, [OBJECT_POS]), 0);
        if ( llVecDist(last_touched_pos, last_touched_pos_now) > 1 )
        {
            last_touched_pos = last_touched_pos_now;
            llFleeFrom(last_touched_pos, 10, []);
        }
    }
}
```

## Notes

The position vector can be set outside the current region by using extended range region coordinates. For example, to avoid the SE corner of the region to the east of the current one:

```lsl
llFleeFrom(<0.0, 512.0, 0.0>, 20.0, []);
```
