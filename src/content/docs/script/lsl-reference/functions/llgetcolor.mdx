  and 1. If face is ALL_SIDES the color returned is the mean average of each
  channel.

```lsl
// Tells the owner the color on all sides
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        integer i = 0;
        integer max = llGetNumberOfSides();
        while(i < max)
        {
            llOwnerSay("Face " + (string) i + " color is " + (string) llGetColor(i));
            ++i;
        }
    }
}
```

## Notes

- When face is `ALL_SIDES`, the returned color is the average of each channel across all faces. Since sRGB is nonlinear, this color may not be particularly meaningful in certain contexts.
- Returns color as a vector with x, y, z components corresponding to red, green, and blue values between 0.0 and 1.0.
