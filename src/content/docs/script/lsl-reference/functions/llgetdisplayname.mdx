### Security

It is a **terrible** idea to tie any security measures to display names; they are not unique and can easily be changed.

### Data Execution

Display names can contain quotes and some punctuation. While this is *not* a problem for LSL, remember to **escape** strings being passed to command line scripts, SQL queries, etc.

## Caveats

- To get around the "avatar must be present" limitation, you can use the `llRequestDisplayName` function and the `dataserver` event to obtain the avatar's display name from a key (this is slower).
- There is no opposite function (`llDisplayName2Key`) available since display names are non-unique.
- Either of `???` or empty string `""` is returned if the region is unable to return display names. This can happen even if display names are enabled on the region, especially the first time a given key is checked. At least one retry may be advisable. Do not rely on this function to verify avatar presence.
- It is possible for `Loading...` to be returned if called before the region has had a chance to resolve the agent's display name.
  - Do *not* retry failed attempts indefinitely in a loop. In a few cases, a display name or username will not be returned for as long as the avatar is in the region.
- If you merely wish to show the agent display name in the viewer window, it may be more straightforward to use Viewer URI Name Space, for example:

```lsl
llSay(0, "secondlife:///app/agent/" + (string)id + "/displayname");
```

## Examples

```lsl
// Best viewed in Chat History (ctrl-h)
default
{
    collision_start(integer a) //Announce who collided
    {
        llSay(0, "llGetDisplayName: " + llGetDisplayName(llDetectedKey(0)) +
                 "\nllDetectedName: " + llDetectedName(0));
    }
    touch_start(integer a)
    {
        llSay(0, "llGetDisplayName: " + llGetDisplayName(llDetectedKey(0)) +
                 "\nllDetectedName: " + llDetectedName(0));
    }
}
```
