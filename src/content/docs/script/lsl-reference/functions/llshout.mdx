- Text can be a maximum of 1024 bytes. This can convey 1024 ASCII characters, or 512 UTF-8 characters such as á
- Shouts can be heard within 100 meters of the speaking prim (rather than the root). This is contrary to how listen works, where a message can only be heard by any prim in the object if and only if the root prim is capable of hearing it.
- A prim can **not** hear itself, this to prevent problems with recursion. It can however hear other prims within the same object. Use llMessageLinked instead for intra-prim messaging.

## Examples

You can make use of certain mnemonic constants such as PUBLIC_CHANNEL instead of channel 0 and DEBUG_CHANNEL instead of channel +2,147,483,647.

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llShout(0, "I scream icecream!");
    }
}
```

For communicating with a user or owner it is preferable to use llOwnerSay or llInstantMessage or llRegionSayTo as they won't spam other users.

The latter is also an excellent choice for communicating to an attachment of a known avatar, or to an object of known UUID.
