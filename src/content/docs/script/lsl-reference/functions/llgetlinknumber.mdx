Links are numbered in the reverse order in which they were linked. For example, if you select a box, a sphere, and a cylinder in that order, then link them:
- The cylinder is link number 1 (the root)
- The sphere is link number 2 (the first child)
- The box is link number 3 (the second child)

The last selected prim has the lowest link number.

## Examples

### Basic Link Number Query

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llOwnerSay((string) llGetLinkNumber());
        llOwnerSay((string) llGetNumberOfPrims());
    }
}
```

### Using Double-Negation for Conditional Logic

A non-obvious feature is using double-negation to obtain a link number zero (for an unlinked prim) or one (for the root of a linkset). Unlike constants like `LINK_ROOT`, this number can be used directly with functions like `llGetLinkPrimitiveParams` without first determining whether a prim is part of a linkset:

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        integer rootLinkNum = !!llGetLinkNumber();
        // returns 0 in an unlinked prim, 1 in a linkset

        integer isFullBright = llList2Integer(llGetLinkPrimitiveParams(rootLinkNum,[PRIM_FULLBRIGHT, ALL_SIDES]),0);
        // TRUE if all sides of an unlinked prim or the root of a linkset are set to full bright, FALSE otherwise
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- By design may equal `llGetNumberOfPrims()` when the prim is last, the object contains multiple prims, and no sitting avatars are present.
