Tell the owner when an object is touched:

```lsl
default
{
    touch_start( integer total_num )
    {
        llInstantMessage( llGetOwner(), "Someone touched me" );
    }
}
```

Send an IM to a detected avatar only:

```lsl
default
{
    touch_start( integer total_num )
    {
        llInstantMessage( llDetectedKey(0), "Hands Off!");
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- All object IMs are throttled at a maximum of 2500 per 30 minutes, per owner, per region, in a rolling window. Throttled IMs are dropped.
- Messages longer than 1023 bytes will be truncated to 1023 bytes. This can convey 1023 ASCII characters, or fewer (around 512 UTF-8 characters) if non-ASCII characters are present.
- If the specified user is logged in, the message will appear in their chat window and will not be logged by the InstantMessage logging facility.
- If the specified user is not signed in, messages will be delivered to their email just like a regular instant message, if the user has enabled email for their account.
- If messages are sent to the same user by the same object within about 65 seconds, they will be bundled together in a single email.

## Notes

- llRegionSayTo may be a better choice if the target is in the same region as the object sending the message, as it has no built-in delay and can communicate directly with objects, as well as with avatars and their attachments.
- Instant Messaging allows communication from an object to an avatar anywhere on the Grid. However, an object cannot receive an Instant Message.
- Using llInstantMessage from one or more child scripts will avoid delays in the main script. Child scripts will still be subject to delays, message queue limits, and region throttles.

### Throttling Implementation Details

- The throttle is on all IMs from the object owner. It does not disable all IMs in the region, but does disable all IMs from the owner of the object.
- The throttle is not per object, but per owner. Splitting the spamming object into multiple objects will not help unless owned by different people.
- 2500 IMs in 30 minutes will trigger the block.
- IMs that are blocked continue to count against the throttle. The IM count must drop below 2500 before any IMs will be delivered.
- The IM count of the previous window is used to approximate the rolling window. If it is 20% into the current window, the IM count will be the current count + 80% of the previous count. This allows approximation of a rolling average, but results in a flood of IMs affecting the throttle for double the window length. In practice, the throttle behaves more like 5k in 1hr than 2.5k in 30 minutes.
