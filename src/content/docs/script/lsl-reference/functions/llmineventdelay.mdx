### Basic Usage

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llMinEventDelay(5.0);
    }
    touch(integer detected)
    {
        llSay(0, "Touched.");
        // Without the event delay set, touch events would cause the screen to fill
        // with "Touched" if you held down the mouse button continuously.
    }
}
```

### Multi-Object Communication Example

Script in "Sandy Powell" object:

```lsl
default
{
    touch(integer detected)
    {
        llSay(0, "Can you hear me mother?");
    }
}
```

Script in "Mother" object:

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llMinEventDelay(5.0);
        llListen(0, "Sandy Powell", "", "");
    }
    listen(integer chan, string name, key id, string msg)
    {
        llSay(0, "Eh?");
    }
}
```

This demonstrates event throttling in action. The `llMinEventDelay(5.0)` call on the listener means it will only process listen events once every 5 seconds. This results in fewer "Eh?" responses and can cause event loss if rapid events are triggered.

## Caveats

- **Minimum delay is maintained between state changes.** The delay applies to all events, even during state transitions.
- **Events can be lost.** If events are triggered more frequently than the minimum delay allows, some events will be discarded. Be careful when setting delays that could cause important events to be missed.
- **Event-specific defaults vary.** Different event types have different default delays and minimum values. See LSL Delay for more information.
