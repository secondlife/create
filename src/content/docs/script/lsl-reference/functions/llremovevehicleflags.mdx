```lsl
default {
    state_entry() {
        // Remove the MOUSELOOK_STEER flag from the vehicle
        llRemoveVehicleFlags(VEHICLE_FLAG_MOUSELOOK_STEER);
    }
}
```

## Notes

- Some vehicle flags may remain enabled after script reset. Use `llRemoveVehicleFlags` to disable any flags that would interfere with the correct functioning of your vehicle.
- The `VEHICLE_FLAG_MOUSELOOK_STEER` and `VEHICLE_FLAG_MOUSELOOK_BANK` flags only allow the vehicle to turn up to the current `VEHICLE_ANGULAR_MOTOR_DIRECTION`; if `VEHICLE_ANGULAR_MOTOR_DIRECTION` is set to `ZERO_VECTOR`, then the vehicle will not turn even if these flags are enabled.
- Use this function in conjunction with `llSetVehicleFlags` to manage which vehicle behaviors are active.
