All three vectors must be mutually orthogonal unit vectors. Technically, only the first two vectors are needed to define the rotation, which can be computed by calling any of these alternatives:

```lsl
llAxes2Rot(fwd, left, fwd % left);
llAxes2Rot(left % up, left, up);
llAxes2Rot(fwd, up % fwd, up);
```

## Examples

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        vector i = < 1.0, 0.0, 0.0>;
        vector j = < 0.0, 1.0, 0.0>;
        vector k = < 0.0, 0.0, 1.0>;

        rotation rot = llAxes2Rot( j, -i, k );

        llSay(0, (string) (llRot2Euler(rot) * RAD_TO_DEG) );
    }
}
```

This script displays:
```
Object: <-0.00000, 0.00000, 90.00000>
```

This shows that **(j, -i, k)** is obtained by rotating **(i, j, k)** 90 degrees around the z direction.
