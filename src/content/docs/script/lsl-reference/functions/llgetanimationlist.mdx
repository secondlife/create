### Simple Animation Override for Walk

This example demonstrates how to override a standard walk animation with a custom animation. It shows practical use of `llGetAnimationList` to detect when a specific animation is playing and swap it for another.

```lsl
//Simple Animation Override for Walk
key old_anim = "6ed24bd8-91aa-4b12-ccc7-c97c857ab4e0";
string new_anim="yoga_float";
integer status;
list check;
key owner;

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        owner = llGetOwner();
        llRequestPermissions(owner, PERMISSION_TRIGGER_ANIMATION);
        check = [old_anim];
    }

    run_time_permissions(integer p)
    {
        if(p & PERMISSION_TRIGGER_ANIMATION)
        {
            llSetTimerEvent(0.2);
        }
    }

    timer()
    {
        if(llGetAgentInfo(owner) & AGENT_WALKING)
        {
            list anims = llGetAnimationList(owner);
            if(~llListFindList(anims, check))
            {
                status = 1;
                llStartAnimation(new_anim);
                llStopAnimation(old_anim);
            }
        }
        else if(status)
        {
            llStopAnimation(new_anim);
            status = 0;
        }
    }

    on_rez(integer p)
    {
        llResetScript();
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- There is no internal mechanism to get the name of the animations playing. You can only work with animation keys.
- Standard animations can be started and stopped by scripts, so the list returned may not accurately reflect the avatar's state. Use `llGetAgentInfo` and `llGetAnimation` when this matters.
- Some motions are local to the viewer and cannot be detected by scripts.
- Animations that are triggered by other animations are local to the viewer and cannot be detected by scripts.
