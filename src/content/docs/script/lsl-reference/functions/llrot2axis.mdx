This function extracts the rotation axis (the vector around which rotation occurs) from a rotation value. The axis is normalized and represents the direction of the rotation.

## Implementation Examples

Here are two equivalent implementations of `llRot2Axis`:

```lsl
vector llRot2Axis(rotation a) {
    if(a.s < 0)
        return -llVecNorm(<a.x, a.y, a.z>);
    return llVecNorm(<a.x, a.y, a.z>)
}
```

Or more concisely:

```lsl
vector llRot2Axis(rotation a) {
    return llVecNorm(<a.x, a.y, a.z>) * (1 | -(a.s < 0));
}
```

The key insight is that the x, y, z components of a rotation represent the axis, and the function normalizes this vector. The scalar component `s` determines the sign of the result.
