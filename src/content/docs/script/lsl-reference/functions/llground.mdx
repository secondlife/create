### Landing on Ground or Water

This example lands an object on the ground or water surface, whichever is higher:

```lsl
FindGroundOrWater()
{
    vector vTarget = llGetPos();
    vTarget.z = llGround(ZERO_VECTOR);
    float fWaterLevel = llWater(ZERO_VECTOR);
    if (vTarget.z < fWaterLevel)
        vTarget.z = fWaterLevel;
    llSetRegionPos(vTarget);
}

default
{
    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        FindGroundOrWater();
    }
}
```
