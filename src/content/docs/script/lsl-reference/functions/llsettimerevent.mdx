- The time between timer events can be longer due to:
  - **Time dilation** - See [llGetRegionTimeDilation](./llgetregiontimedilaion/) for more information
  - **Default event delay** - Only so many events can be triggered per second
  - **Event Execution** - If the execution of an event takes too long
- The timer persists across state changes but gets removed when the script is reset. If you change to a state that has a timer event with the timer still running, it will fire in the new state
- Setting a new timer replaces the old timer and resets the timer clock
  - If you repeatedly call this function at some interval less than `sec`, the timer event will never fire
- The timer event is not an interrupt; it will not pause the execution of the currently running event to execute the timer. The current event must finish executing before the timer executes

## Examples

### Basic Timer Usage

```lsl
// default of counter is 0 upon script load
integer counter;
float   gap = 2.0;

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSetTimerEvent(gap);
    }

    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        llSay(0, "The timer stops.");
        llSetTimerEvent(0.0);
        counter = 0;
    }

    timer()
    {
        ++counter;
        llSay(0,
            (string)counter+" ticks have passed in " + (string)llGetTime()
            + " script seconds.\nEstimated elapsed time: " + (string)(counter * gap));
    }
}
```

### Random Timer Interval

```lsl
//  random period in between (+15.0, +30.0]
//  which means the resulting float could be 30.0 but not 15.0

    llSetTimerEvent( 30.0 - llFrand(15.0) );

//  same results for:
//  llSetTimerEvent( 30.0 + llFrand(-15.0) );
```

### Timer with Sensor (Events That Interfere)

```lsl
// The timer event will never fire.
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSetTimerEvent(5.0);
        // Sensor every 2.5 seconds
        llSensorRepeat("", NULL_KEY, FALSE, 0.0, 0.0, 2.5);
    }

    no_sensor()
    {
        llSetTimerEvent(5.0);
    }

    timer()
    {
        llSay(0, "I will never happen.");
        llSay(0, "Well, unless llSensorRepeat() magically finds something,"+
                    "or maybe there's 2.5+ seconds of lag and the timer()"+
                    "event queues.");
    }
}
```

### Simulating Multiple Timers

```lsl
// Using a timer to simulate multiple timers
integer counter_a = 0;
integer counter_b = 0;

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        //Starting Timer Event
        llSetTimerEvent(1.0);
    }

    timer()
    {
        //Increment counters
        counter_a++;
        counter_b++;

        if(counter_a >= 100)
        {
            //Resetting Counter A
            counter_a = 0;
            llOwnerSay("Counter a has reached 100");
        }

        if(counter_b >= 200)
        {
            //Resetting counter B
            counter_b = 0;
            llOwnerSay("Counter b has reached 200");
        }

    }
}
```
