title: llGetExperienceDetails
description: |2-

                     Returns a list with the following Experience properties: [Experience Name, Owner ID, Group ID, Experience ID, State, State Message]. State is an integer corresponding to one of the constants XP_ERROR_... and State Message is the string returned by llGetExperienceErrorMessage for that integer.

The function returns a list with 6 components:
1. `string experience_name` - The name of the experience
2. `key owner_id` - The owner's key ID
3. `key experience_id` - The experience's key ID
4. `integer state` - An integer status code (corresponds to XP_ERROR_... constants)
5. `string state_message` - A string describing the state
6. `key group_id` - The group associated with the experience

When `experience_id` is `NULL_KEY`, information about the script's own experience is returned. If the script isn't associated with an experience, an empty list is returned.

## Examples

```lsl
default {
    touch_start(integer total_number) {
        key xp = "9170c22b-f445-ea5d-89fa-0f2f1e144f04";
        llOwnerSay(llDumpList2String(llGetExperienceDetails(xp), "\n"));
        // Prints:
        // Linden Realms
        // id
        // status msg

        llOwnerSay(llDumpList2String(llGetExperienceDetails(NULL_KEY), "\n"));
        // Print nothing if not associated with an experience or info about the associated experience
    }
}
```

## Notes

- If `experience_id` is `NULL_KEY`, the function returns details about the script's own experience
- If the script isn't associated with an experience, an empty list is returned
- Known issue: Returns 4 for `state` and "operation not permitted" for `state_message` while over mainland parcels that have the experience allowed (BUG-7048)
