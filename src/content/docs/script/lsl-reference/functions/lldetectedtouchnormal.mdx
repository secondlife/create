  Returns the surface normal for a triggered touch event.

  Returns a vector that is the surface normal (perpendicular to the surface)
  where the touch event was triggered.

The surface normal returned represents a vector perpendicular to the surface where the touch event was triggered. Along with `llDetectedTouchBinormal`, this information can be used to find the tangent space at the touch location. To find the third tangent vector, cross the binormal with this vector.

## Caveats

- `TOUCH_INVALID_VECTOR` (same as ZERO_VECTOR `<0.0, 0.0, 0.0>`) is returned when:
  - The avatar's viewer does not support face touch detection (check `llDetectedTouchFace` to verify support)
  - The touch has moved off the surface of the prim
  - The event triggered is not a touch event
- The rotation of a legacy sphere prim does not influence touch normal like it does with other legacy prims
- For touch events only: the prim that was touched may not be the prim receiving the event. Use `llDetectedLinkNumber` to check this, and `llDetectedTouchFace` to determine which face was touched

## Examples

```lsl
default {
    touch_start(integer total_num) {
        llOwnerSay((string)llDetectedTouchNormal(0)); // Says the vector where the touched face is pointing to.
    }
}
```

Rotate a prim so the touched position points upwards:

```lsl
touch_start(integer total_number) {
    // rotates the prim, so the touched position points upwards
    llSetRot(llGetRot() * llRotBetween(llDetectedTouchNormal(0), <0, 0, 1>));
}
```
