- If either value is ZERO_VECTOR, the function eliminates both forces. Both values must be non-zero for this function to work. (The workaround to this is setting both separately.)

## Examples

```lsl
default
{
    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        llSetForceAndTorque( <0.0,0.0,5.0>, <1.0,0.0,0.0>, FALSE );
    }
}
```
