title: llKeysKeyValue
description: |2-

                     Starts an asychronous transaction the request a number of keys from the data store. The dataserver callback will be executed with the key returned from this call and a string describing the result. The result is commma-delimited list. The first item is an integer specifying if the transaction succeeded (1) or not (0). In the failure case, the second item will be an integer corresponding to one of the XP_ERROR_... constants. The error XP_ERROR_KEY_NOT_FOUND is returned if First is greater than or equal to the number of keys in the data store. In the success case the subsequent items will be the keys requested. The number of keys returned may be less than requested if the return value is too large or if there is not enough keys remaining. The order keys are returned is not guaranteed but is stable between subsequent calls as long as no keys are added or removed. Because the keys are returned in a comma-delimited list it is not recommended to use commas in key names if this function is used.
