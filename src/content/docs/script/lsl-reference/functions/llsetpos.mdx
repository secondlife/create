title: llSetPos
description: >-
  If the object is not physical, this function sets the position of the prim.

  If the script is in a child prim, Position is treated as root relative and the
  link-set is adjusted.

  If the prim is the root prim, the entire object is moved (up to 10m) to
  Position in region coordinates.

- **Root prims (or single prim objects)**
  - **Attached:** `pos` is a local coordinate relative to the attach point.
  - **Not attached:** `pos` is a region coordinate.
- **Child prims (non-root prims):** `pos` is a local coordinate relative to the root prim.

## Caveats

- This function has a movement cap of 10m and a time delay of 0.2 seconds per call. Consider using `llSetRegionPos` and/or `llSetLinkPrimitiveParamsFast` instead.
- Because of the intermixing of local and regional coordinates with this function, when a prim's position is wanted it is best to use `llGetLocalPos`.
- This function does not work in the root prim of physical objects. Use a physical function like `llMoveToTarget` instead.
- If you have explicitly set your object as "static obstacle" for pathfinding, the function will fail with the error in the debug channel: "Unable to set prim position or scale: object contributes to the navmesh."

## Examples

### Move Object Up

```lsl
// Move the object up 1m when someone touches it
default {
    touch_start(integer i) {
        llSetPos(llGetPos() + <0,0,1>);
    }
}
```

### Movement Workaround for Small Movements

```lsl
// To bypass the small movement bug
// Created by Madpeter Zond
// Notes: it does not check if the movement would go out of limit range for linked prims
llSetLocalPos(vector offset)
{
    vector save = offset;
    if(offset.x < 0.0) offset.x -= 1;
    else offset.x += 1;
    if(offset.y < 0.0) offset.y -= 1;
    else offset.y += 1;
    if(offset.z < 0.0) offset.z -= 1;
    else offset.z += 1;
    llSetPos(offset);
    llSetPos(save);
}
```

## Notes

Multiple movement commands can be chained together with `llSetPrimitiveParams` and `PRIM_POSITION`. The advantage of doing this is that the script only sleeps once per function call instead of once per movement.
