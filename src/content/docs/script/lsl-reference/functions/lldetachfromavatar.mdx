- Only works in the root prim of the attachment; calling it from a script in a child prim will cause it to fail silently.
- If the attachment was attached using `llAttachToAvatarTemp`, the `attach()` event will not be called because the object will be destroyed before the event gets processed.

## Notes

- The detached object remains in the user's inventory (unless it was a temporary attachment, in which case it will be destroyed).
- The detached object is no longer present in the sim. There is no LSL equivalent of the "Drop" command that moves an attachment onto the ground. Use `llRezObject` if you need similar behavior.
- There is no way to delete an attachment with a script or to drop it to the ground.

## Examples

```lsl
default
{
    attach(key AvatarKey)
    {
        // Give instructions for use and prevent item from being attached to avatar
        if(AvatarKey)
        {
            // Event is called on both attach and detach, but Key is only valid on attach
            llOwnerSay("We hope you will enjoy your purchase, but if you really want to use this item properly, you should: 1) drag it from your inventory to the ground 2) Right click on it and select \"open\" 3) copy its contents to inventory.");
            llRequestPermissions(AvatarKey, PERMISSION_ATTACH);
        }
    }
    run_time_permissions(integer perm)
    {
        if(perm & PERMISSION_ATTACH)
        {
            llDetachFromAvatar();
        }
    }
}
```
