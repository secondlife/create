Computes the orientation of the local z-axis (up-direction of prim) relative to the parent (the root prim or the world).

## Mathematical Equivalent

Mathematically equivalent to:

```lsl
ret = llVecNorm(<0., 0., 1.> * q);
```

If `q` is known to be a unit quaternion then it can be simplified as:

```lsl
ret = <0., 0., 1.> * q;
```

Keep in mind that object and agent rotations will always be unit quaternions. For example, `<0.0, 0.0, 1.0>*llGetRot()` is about 25-30% faster than `llRot2Up(llGetRot())` depending on the VM used. If done often and at extremely fast rates, it can be advantageous to even save `<0.0, 0.0, 1.0>` to a local/global variable and reuse it.

## Examples

Move a prim 5 metres forwards along its own z axis, when touched, no matter how the object is oriented in world. This works for a root or child prim:

```lsl
default
{
    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        vector v = llRot2Up( llGetLocalRot() );
        llSetPos( llGetLocalPos() + v * 5 );
    }
}
```

## Notes

Can be useful to identify the orientation of the local horizontal-plane of the prim, since its z-axis is always perpendicular to this local horizontal plane.
