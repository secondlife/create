llDetectedDamage returns a list describing a single damage event. This function is only available from within an `on_damage` handler. If called from another detection event or from a non-detection handler, it will return an empty list.

The list has the following format:

```lsl
[float damage, integer damage_type, float original_damage]
```

### Return Parameters

- **damage**: The current amount of damage that will be applied after all `on_damage` events have completed processing.
- **damage_type**: An integer describing the type of damage that will be applied. This could reflect one of the `DAMAGE_TYPE_*` constants, a custom damage type constant, or be a repurposed field as it can be set to anything.
- **original_damage**: The original amount of damage that was specified when the event was triggered, either through a collision or a call to llDamage.

## Notes

- Returns an empty list if the number parameter does not relate to a valid damage source or if called from a handler other than `on_damage`.
- Available only within `on_damage` event handlers.
