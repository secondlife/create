title: llPassCollisions
description: >-
  Configures how collision events are passed to scripts in the linkset.

  If Pass == TRUE, collisions involving collision-handling scripted child prims
  are also passed on to the root prim. If Pass == FALSE (default behavior), such
  collisions will only trigger events in the affected child prim.

```lsl
default {
    collision_start(integer num_detected) {
        // Enable collision pass-through for child prims
        llPassCollisions(TRUE);
        llSay(0, "Collision pass-through enabled");
    }
}
```

## Notes

- By default (`Pass` = FALSE), collisions are only reported in the script of the prim that actually collided
- When `Pass` is set to TRUE, collisions involving child prims with collision handlers will also be passed to the root prim's scripts
- Useful in linked object scenarios where you want the root prim to be aware of collisions happening to any part of the linkset
- This function affects how collision events (`collision_start`, `collision`, `collision_end`) are propagated through the linkset
