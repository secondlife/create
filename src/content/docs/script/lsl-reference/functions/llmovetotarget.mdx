title: llMoveToTarget
description: >-
  Critically damp to Target in Tau seconds (if the script is physical).

  Critically damp to position target in tau-seconds if the script is physical.
  Good tau-values are greater than 0.2. A tau of 0.0 stops the critical damping.

Drop this script in a prim to have it follow the prim owner.

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        vector pos = llGetPos();
        llSetStatus(STATUS_PHYSICS, TRUE);
        // Little pause to allow server to make potentially large linked object physical.
        llSleep(0.1);
        llMoveToTarget(pos,0.4);
        // Look for owner within 20 meters in 360 degree arc every 1 seconds.
        llSensorRepeat("", llGetOwner(), AGENT, 20.0, PI,1.0);
    }
    sensor(integer total_number)
    {
        // Get position of detected owner
        vector pos = llDetectedPos(0);
        // Offset back one meter in X and up one meter in Z based on world coordinates.
        vector offset =<-1,0,1>;
//        offset = offset*llDetectedRot(0);  //Adding this line will orient the follower relative to the owner's position.
        pos+=offset;
        llMoveToTarget(pos,0.4);
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- When slowly moving to a lower Z value, beware of SVC-2441: the sim will incorrectly move the object down faster than it should. For example, if you try moving to `llGetPos() + <10, 10, -10>`, you can end up at `.z-10` several meters before getting to `.x-10` and `.y-10`.
- A `llMoveToTarget` call seems to persist even if physics is turned off. This is a useful trick on sluggish sims where the object can drop a bit between the call to enable physics and the call to `llMoveToTarget` - just do the `llMoveToTarget` before setting the object to physical.
- `llVecDist(llGetPos(), target)` must be *less than* 65, or no movement will occur.
- Calling `llMoveToTarget` with a `tau` of 0.0 or less will silently fail and do nothing. The smallest functional `tau` is 0.044444444 (two physics frames, 2/45).

## Notes

- The function uses critical damping to move the object to the target position over `tau` seconds (only if the script is physical).
- Good tau values are greater than 0.2.
- To stop the object from maintaining the target position, use `llStopMoveToTarget`.
- To change the rotation in the same manner, use `llLookAt` or `llRotLookAt`.
