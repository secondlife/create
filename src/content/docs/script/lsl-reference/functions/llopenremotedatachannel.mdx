XML-RPC should not be used anymore. Use [HTTP Server](/script/reference/lsl/functions/llHTTPResponse/) instead, which is the modern replacement.

## Caveats

- If an object moves from one region to another it must re-open the channel
  - The object will get the *same* channel as before, but without re-opening no requests will get through
- Any channel that is not used for 14 days will be cleaned up
  - It may be advisable to somewhat regularly (before expected use or on a regular schedule) check that the channel is good and hasn't changed by calling `llOpenRemoteDataChannel` and comparing to the previous channel
- XML-RPC requests often time-out due to the front-end server being overloaded
  - LL has continued to upgrade the server hardware periodically, but it has remained unreliable
  - LL developers have advised that the XML-RPC design isn't scalable (due to the single server bottle-neck) and that the service is "deprecated"
  - If an XML-RPC request does time-out, the script's `remote_data` event may or may not be triggered (and any script response is lost)

## Examples

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llOpenRemoteDataChannel();
    }
    changed(integer c)
    {
        if(c & (CHANGED_REGION | CHANGED_TELEPORT))
            llOpenRemoteDataChannel();
    }
    remote_data( integer event_type, key channel, key message_id, string sender, integer idata, string sdata )
    {
        if (event_type == REMOTE_DATA_CHANNEL) { // channel created
        }
    }
}
```
