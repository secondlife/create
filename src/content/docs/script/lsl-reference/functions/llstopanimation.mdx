- If the animation to be stopped is the only playing animation (as found via `llGetAnimationList`), it will continue to play to its end (if looped it will continue indefinitely)
  - If you must stop a looped animation, playing a single frame non-looped one immediately after stopping it, at low priority, will clear the list.

## Examples

### Basic Animation Control

```lsl
default
{
    touch_start(integer detected)
    {
        llRequestPermissions(llDetectedKey(0), PERMISSION_TRIGGER_ANIMATION);
    }
    run_time_permissions(integer perm)
    {
        if (perm & PERMISSION_TRIGGER_ANIMATION)
        {
            llStartAnimation("sit");
            llOwnerSay("animation will end in 5 seconds");
            llSetTimerEvent(5.0);
        }
    }
    timer()
    {
        llSetTimerEvent(0.0);
        llStopAnimation("sit");
    }
}
```

### Using Animation Overrides

```lsl
llStopAnimation(llGetAnimationOverride("Sitting"))
```
