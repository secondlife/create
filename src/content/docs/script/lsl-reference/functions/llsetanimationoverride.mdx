```lsl
// Override the Sit, Stand and Walk animations
// 1. place this script and your animations in a prim
// 2. edit the animation names in the script to your animation's names
// 3. attach the prim to your avatar

string gMySit = "chop_sit";
string gMyStand = "FStand _02";
string gMyWalk = "Kort gang F v4.1";

default
{
    attach(key id)
    {
        if ( id ) llRequestPermissions(id , PERMISSION_OVERRIDE_ANIMATIONS);
        else if ( llGetPermissions() & PERMISSION_OVERRIDE_ANIMATIONS ) llResetAnimationOverride("ALL");
    }
    run_time_permissions(integer perms)
    {
        if ( perms & PERMISSION_OVERRIDE_ANIMATIONS )
        {
            llSetAnimationOverride( "Sitting", gMySit);
            llSetAnimationOverride( "Standing", gMyStand);
            llSetAnimationOverride( "Walking", gMyWalk);
        }
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- Animation overrides survive script reset, script removal, attachment removal, crossing into another region and teleporting, but **not relog**.
- State "Sit on Ground" will play the default animation in addition to any override set. This is required for correct viewer behavior.
- Some states are transitional and have undefined behavior if set to continuously looping animations. These states are "PreJumping", "Landing", "Soft Landing" and "Standing Up".
  - Usually this means your avatar will become frozen in place unless you run "Stop Animating My Avatar" from the viewer, so avoid using looping animations for these states.
- Permissions aren't auto granted if you sit on an object asking for PERMISSION_OVERRIDE_ANIMATIONS.
- Starting a default animation ("sit" "walk" "fly") with `llStartAnimation` will not start the Override Animation.
- When this function is used to override the Walking animation, the avatar can no longer walk backward - attempting to do so causes the avatar to turn around. Presumably this is because there's no way to specify a "walking backwards" animation, so actually moving backwards while your legs are moving forward would look wrong.
