```lsl
// Reports an object's mass in Lindograms and Kilograms.
default
{
    touch_start()
    {
        llSay(0, "My weight in Lindograms: " + (string)llGetMass() + "\nMy weight in Kilograms: " + (string)llGetMassMKS());
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- Attachments do not affect an avatar's mass, only certain Appearance settings.
- Avatar mass is reported to either be unexpectedly low (when measured using `llGetMass`) or unexpectedly high (when measured using `llGetMassMKS`). This is likely due to the weight being calculated based on a fixed value, with a modifier for height. The fixed value being used is incorrect, likely due to an incorrect density value being used.

## Notes

- The Kilogram value seems to be the Lindogram value (reported by `llGetMass()`) multiplied by 100.
- **MKS** as used in the name of this function is likely a reference to the [MKS system of units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKS_system_of_units) (Meter, Kilogram, Second), which form the base of SI units (with some minor differences).
