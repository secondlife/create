```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llLoopSound("string soundname if in object inventory or UUID", 1.0);
    }
    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        llStopSound();//As if by magic the sound stops!!
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- There is no way to stop a specific sound.
- In a linked set use llLinkStopSound to stop sound in a specific prim.
