## Caveats

- HUD attachment keys are not reported by this function by design.
- When an avatar first arrives in a region, there is a brief period when their attachments are not yet fully rezzed or added. During this time, those attachments will not appear in the results.
- If the avatar is a child agent, `["NOT ON REGION"]` is returned.
- If the avatar is not a main agent and not a child agent or not an agent at all, `["NOT FOUND"]` is returned.
