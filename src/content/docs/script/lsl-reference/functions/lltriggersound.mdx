title: llTriggerSound
description: >-
  Plays Sound at Volume (0.0 - 1.0), centered at but not attached to object.

  There is no limit to the number of triggered sounds which can be generated by
  an object, and calling llTriggerSound does not affect the attached sounds
  created by llPlaySound and llLoopSound. This is very useful for things like
  collision noises, explosions, etc. There is no way to stop or alter the volume
  of a sound triggered by this function.

    }
}
```

## Caveats

- If the object moves, the sound does not move with it. Use [llPlaySound] to play a sound attached to the object.
- Sounds played from a HUD using llTriggerSound are audible inworld. To make sounds from a HUD audible only to the wearer, use [llPlaySound].
- Playing sounds is throttled. If the average number of played sounds per second exceeds the limit (22 sounds/s), all sounds from the object are suppressed until the average falls sufficiently. The throttle is per object, not per link or per script, so multiple links cannot be used to overcome the throttle.
  - Once the throttle is hit, the following error will be shown in debug channel: "Too many sound requests. Throttled until average falls."
