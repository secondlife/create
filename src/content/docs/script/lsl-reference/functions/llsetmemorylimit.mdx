title: llSetMemoryLimit
description: |-
  Requests Limit bytes to be reserved for this script.
  Returns TRUE or FALSE indicating whether the limit was set successfully.
  This function has no effect if the script is running in the LSO VM.

### Mono

- The memory limit can be set up to 64KB
- The memory limit cannot be set lower than the memory currently in use by the script
- All new scripts start with a limit of 64KB
- Mono scripts compiled before this function was introduced continue to use the 64KB limit
- A lower limit will affect the amount of memory reported in the viewer UI and by `llGetObjectDetails`
- The memory limit is not the amount of real memory actually used by the script, just the upper limit on it

### LSO

- Has no effect on LSO scripts, which will always use exactly 16KB

## Caveats

- When the limit value is too small, `llSetMemoryLimit(limit)` is ignored and the memory limit is not changed

## Examples

```lsl
// Memory-walkthrough by Daemonika Nightfire (daemonika.nightfire)

integer limit = 20000; // <- bytes

Test()
{
    llSetText("Limited Memory " + (string)llGetMemoryLimit() +
              "\nUsed Memory " + (string)llGetUsedMemory() +
              "\nFree Memory " + (string)llGetFreeMemory(),<1,1,1>,1);
}

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSetMemoryLimit(limit);

        llScriptProfiler(PROFILE_SCRIPT_MEMORY);
        Test();
        llScriptProfiler(PROFILE_NONE);

        llSay(0,"This script used at most " + (string)llGetSPMaxMemory() + " bytes of memory during Test.");
    }
}

// Result:

// Floating Text:
// Limited Memory 20000
// Used Memory 4972
// Free Memory 15100

// Chat:
// [05:11] Object: This script used at most 4972 bytes of memory during Test.
```
