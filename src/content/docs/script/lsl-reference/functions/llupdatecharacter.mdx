```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llCreateCharacter([CHARACTER_DESIRED_SPEED, 10.0]);

        list points = [llGetPos() + <5,0,0>, llGetPos() - <5,0,0>];
        llPatrolPoints(points, []);
    }

    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        llUpdateCharacter([CHARACTER_DESIRED_SPEED, 50.0]);
    }
}
```

## Parameters

### CHARACTER_DESIRED_SPEED
- Ranges from 0.2 to 40.0

### CHARACTER_RADIUS
- Ranges from 0.1 to 5.0

### CHARACTER_LENGTH
- Ranges from 0.0 to 10.0

### TRAVERSAL_TYPE
- Use one of: `TRAVERSAL_TYPE_SLOW`, `TRAVERSAL_TYPE_FAST`, `TRAVERSAL_TYPE_NONE`
- Defaults to `TRAVERSAL_TYPE_NONE` if omitted
- Controls how a character moves on terrain with less than 100% walkability (e.g., SLOW for a cat crossing a street, FAST for a car in a swamp)

### CHARACTER_TYPE
- Use one of: `CHARACTER_TYPE_A`, `CHARACTER_TYPE_B`, `CHARACTER_TYPE_C`, `CHARACTER_TYPE_D`, `CHARACTER_TYPE_NONE`
- Defaults to `CHARACTER_TYPE_NONE` if omitted
- Determines which of the 4 walkability coefficients the character uses

## Caveats

- This function is subject to change
- Character shape is a capsule (cylinder with spherical ends) defined by `CHARACTER_LENGTH` (tip to tip) and `CHARACTER_RADIUS` (circular cross-section)
- The character's true length cannot be smaller than twice the radius; however, you can specify a value lower than that (but greater than zero) and the script won't complain
- The capsule is usually oriented vertically; you can make it horizontal by using an object long in its local X-axis, but horizontal capsules may become stuck more easily
- **Use a vertical capsule whenever possible**
- Removing the script from a prim will not stop pathing behavior (similar to particles and hover text). To stop a pathing command, use `llExecCharacterCmd(CHARACTER_CMD_STOP, [])`
