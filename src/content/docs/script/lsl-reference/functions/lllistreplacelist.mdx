title: llListReplaceList
description: >-
  Returns a list that is Target with Start through End removed and ListVariable
  inserted at Start.

  Returns a list replacing the slice of the Target list from Start to End with
  the specified ListVariable. Start and End are inclusive, so 0, 1 would replace
  the first two entries and 0, 0 would replace only the first list entry.

- If `start` is past the end of `dest`, then `src` is appended to `dest`; it will not add null entries. To avoid this, create empty elements in the list first. A similar outcome occurs when using negative indexes.
- Just calling the function will not update the variable. You must store it (unless of course you are planning to act on the results straight away).

  **Bad:**
  ```lsl
  llListReplaceList(MyList, ["New Item"], 2, 2)
  ```

  **Good:**
  ```lsl
  MyList = llListReplaceList(MyList, ["New Item"], 2, 2)
  ```

- In LSO ONLY (not Mono): if you are storing to the same list, it can be more memory effective to clear the list before you store.

  **Good:**
  ```lsl
  MyList = llListReplaceList(MyList, ["New Item"], 2, 2)
  ```

  **Better:**
  ```lsl
  MyList = llListReplaceList((MyList = []) + MyList, ["New Item"], 2, 2)
  ```

## Examples

```lsl
default {
    state_entry() {
        list MyOldList = ["a", "b", "e", "d"];
        list MyNewList = llListReplaceList(MyOldList, ["c"], 2, 2);  // Replace the range starting and ending at index 2 with ["c"]

        llOwnerSay("\"" + llList2CSV(MyOldList) + "\"  ->  \"" + llList2CSV(MyNewList) + "\"");
        // Will say: "a, b, e, d"  ->  "a, b, c, d"
    }
}
```

More commonly, you will be updating an existing list, replacing 1 or more items:

```lsl
default {
    state_entry() {
        list MyList = ["a", "b", "x", "y"];
        MyList = llListReplaceList(MyList, ["c", "d"], 2, 3);  // Replace entries 2 & 3 with new values

        llOwnerSay("\"" + llList2CSV(MyList) + "\"");  // Display the modified list
        // Will say: "a, b, c, d"
    }
}
```

## Notes

- To be clear, the list you are replacing in doesn't have to actually be a list of many elements. It can be a single item that you make into a single element list just by placing square brackets around it.

  ```lsl
  list TargetList = ["a", "b", "c", "z", "e"];
  list InsertList = ["d"];
  ```

- To act on a single element in a list, just specify its index as both start and end. For instance, `0, 0` would act only on the first element in the list; `7, 7` would act only on the 8th element.

- For a function that will operate as `llListReplaceList` does, but work on strided lists, see `ListStridedUpdate`.
