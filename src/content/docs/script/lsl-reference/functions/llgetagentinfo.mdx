## Caveats

- `AGENT_BUSY` indicates that the "busy" internal animation is playing, even if the user is not truly in busy mode.
- **On server 1.40 and below**, `AGENT_TYPING` indicated that the "type" internal animation is playing, it would not be set if the user disabled PlayTypingAnim. **On server 1.42 and up**, it reflects typing start/stop messages from the client and does not depend on the animation.
- `AGENT_ALWAYS_RUN | AGENT_WALKING` indicates that the user requested to run using standard viewer controls. Use `llGetAnimation()` to also detect running caused by physics.
- This function does not return reliable information immediately after a border crossing. Use `llGetAnimation()` instead, if you can.
- `AGENT_AUTOMATED` may unexpectedly be enabled, see AGENT_AUTOMATED for more detail.

## Notes

This is not a good way of testing if an avatar is in the region, use `llGetAgentSize()` instead.
