Unlike `llList2CSV`, which dumps a list to a comma-separated formatted string with no choice over the separator, `llDumpList2String` gives you more control. This can be useful if you don't trust commas as a separator because you might be working with data supplied to the script by a user who uses, say, commas as part of a street address.

## Examples

```lsl
list mylist = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
string tmp = llDumpList2String(mylist, "**");
//tmp now equals: "a**b**c**d"
```

```lsl
list mylist = [<10,5,7>, 100, "c", "d"];
string tmp = llDumpList2String(mylist, "**");
//tmp now equals: "<10,5,7>**100**c**d"
```

```lsl
default {
    state_entry() {
        list my_list = [1, 2.0, "a string", llGetOwner()];
        llOwnerSay("<" + llDumpList2String(my_list, "><") + ">");
        //says: "<1><2.000000><a string><a822ff2b-ff02-461d-b45d-dcd10a2de0c2>"
    }
}
```

## Notes

- Instead of using `llDumpList2String(myList, "")` you may wish to consider using the more efficient `(string)myList` as it produces an identical result with less memory usage due to eliminating a function-call.
- Each element of the list is converted to string format in the result, so floats expand to six digits of precision, rotations and vectors are represented with "\<" and "\>" characters, etc.
