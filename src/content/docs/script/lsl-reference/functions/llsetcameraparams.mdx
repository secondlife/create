- Camera control is currently only supported for attachments and objects on which you are sitting. An attempt otherwise will result in an error being shouted on DEBUG_CHANNEL.
- Scripted camera parameters are overridden for agents who are in Free Camera mode (Alt + Click). **No error is returned if this is the case**; however when the agent returns to regular camera mode, their camera will go to the scripted camera position.
- When CAMERA_FOCUS is not defined, it is advised that CAMERA_FOCUS_THRESHOLD is set to 0.0 - this is because when left at its default value, it may prevent the camera from focusing on the correct point, instead focusing just to the side of the intended point.
- A CAMERA_FOCUS_OFFSET of ZERO_VECTOR will always look at the same position as returned by llGetPos() for the avatar
  - When seated, this is also the position of "Avatar Center" when hover height is 0
  - When standing, this has a shape-dependent z-offset from "Avatar Center"
- Cannot be used to control the camera in Mouselook.

## Examples

### Region Relative Coordinates

This example sets the camera in region relative coordinates with both focus and position locked:

```lsl
lookAtMe(integer perms)
{
    if (perms & PERMISSION_CONTROL_CAMERA)
    {
        vector camPos = llGetPos() + (relCamP * llGetRot() * turnOnChair);
        vector camFocus = llGetPos();
        llClearCameraParams(); // reset camera to default
        llSetCameraParams([
            CAMERA_ACTIVE, 1, // 1 is active, 0 is inactive
            CAMERA_FOCUS, camFocus, // region relative position
            CAMERA_FOCUS_LOCKED, TRUE, // (TRUE or FALSE)
            CAMERA_POSITION, camPos, // region relative position
            CAMERA_POSITION_LOCKED, TRUE // (TRUE or FALSE)
        ]);
    }
}
```

Note that Focus and Position are both locked. This example makes the camera look at `camFocus` from `camPos`.

### Camera Follow Avatar

This example makes the camera follow a pilot on a vehicle. Note that Focus and Position are NOT locked and not even set:

```lsl
lookAtMe(integer perms)
{
    if (perms & PERMISSION_CONTROL_CAMERA)
    {
        llClearCameraParams(); // reset camera to default
        llSetCameraParams([
            CAMERA_ACTIVE, 1, // 1 is active, 0 is inactive
            CAMERA_BEHINDNESS_ANGLE, 30.0, // (0 to 180) degrees
            CAMERA_BEHINDNESS_LAG, 0.0, // (0 to 3) seconds
            CAMERA_DISTANCE, 10.0, // (0.5 to 10) meters
            //CAMERA_FOCUS, <0,0,5>, // region relative position
            CAMERA_FOCUS_LAG, 0.05, // (0 to 3) seconds
            CAMERA_FOCUS_LOCKED, FALSE, // (TRUE or FALSE)
            CAMERA_FOCUS_THRESHOLD, 0.0, // (0 to 4) meters
            CAMERA_PITCH, 10.0, // (-45 to 80) degrees
            //CAMERA_POSITION, <0,0,0>, // region relative position
            CAMERA_POSITION_LAG, 0.0, // (0 to 3) seconds
            CAMERA_POSITION_LOCKED, FALSE, // (TRUE or FALSE)
            CAMERA_POSITION_THRESHOLD, 0.0, // (0 to 4) meters
            CAMERA_FOCUS_OFFSET, <2.0, 0.0, 0.0> // <-10,-10,-10> to <10,10,10> meters
        ]);
    }
}
```
