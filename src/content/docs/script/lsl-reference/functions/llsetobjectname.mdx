- The name is limited to 63 characters. Longer prim names are cut short.
- Names can only consist of the 95 printable characters found in the ASCII-7 (non-extended) character set, with the exception of the vertical bar/pipe ("|") character.
  - Invalid characters in the range 1 to 31, as well as the pipe character (124) are replaced with a question mark ("?").
  - Other invalid characters in the range 128 and above are replaced with two or more question marks, depending on how many bytes their UTF-8 representation requires.
  - Objects with all-whitespace names (e.g., a space or a series of spaces) will appear as "(Unnamed)" if they emit chat via llSay, llOwnerSay, llInstantMessage, etc., although this behaviour may vary in third-party viewers.
- While an object is attached, the script cannot change the name of the object as it appears in the user's inventory.
  - Changes to the name of the root prim will not be saved to inventory; when the attachment is detached (to inventory, not dropped) this name change is discarded and the name in inventory is used instead.
  - When attachment is dropped (to the ground) and taking it into inventory, the inventory item will have the new name (not the old).
- Changes to the names of child prims will be saved back to inventory when the object is detached to inventory. They survive detachment.
- Changes to the object name do not trigger a changed event.
- If this function is called from a child prim in a linked set, it will change the name of the child prim and not the root prim.

## Examples

**Set this prim's name:**

```lsl
default {
    state_entry() {
        llSetObjectName("NEW PRIM NAME");
    }
}
```

**Set the root prim's name:**

```lsl
default {
    state_entry() {
        llSetLinkPrimitiveParamsFast(LINK_ROOT,
            [PRIM_NAME, "NEW ROOT PRIM NAME"]);
    }
}
```

**Test if a string is valid as an object name:**

```lsl
// Returns TRUE if 'name' is a valid object name, FALSE otherwise
integer isValidObjectName(string name) {
    string original_name = llGetObjectName();
    llSetObjectName(name);
    integer valid_name = llGetObjectName() == name;
    llSetObjectName(original_name);
    return valid_name;
}
```
