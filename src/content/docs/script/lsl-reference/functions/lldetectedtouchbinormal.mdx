## Caveats

- `TOUCH_INVALID_VECTOR` (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) is returned when:
  - The avatar's viewer does not support face touch detection. To check if face touch detection is supported, check the return of `llDetectedTouchFace`.
  - The touch has moved off the surface of the prim.
  - The event triggered is not a touch event.

## Notes

- This function is for touch category events only.
- The prim that was touched may not be the prim receiving the event. Use `llDetectedLinkNumber` to check for this.
- Use `llDetectedTouchFace` to determine which face was touched.
- To find the third tangent vector, cross this vector with the normal from `llDetectedTouchNormal`. This information can be used to find the tangent space at the touch location.
