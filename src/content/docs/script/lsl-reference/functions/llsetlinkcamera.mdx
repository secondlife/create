- Setting this will not update the cameras of seated avatars; it will only affect avatars that subsequently sit down. The camera settings have to be prepared in advance.
- The offsets `at` and `eye` are locally relative to the prim. If you want them relative to the seated avatar (which likely has a custom sit rotation and offset) or the region, you must do the computation yourself.
- Camera position and focus set by this function is a **Prim Property**. It will survive the script and it will survive prim taking and prim rezzing.
