title: llListRandomize
description: >-
  Returns a version of the input ListVariable which has been randomized by
  blocks of size Stride.

  If the remainder from the length of the list, divided by the stride is
  non-zero, this function does not randomize the list.

### Basic Randomization

```lsl
list dice = ["2", "4", "1", "6", "3", "5"];

default
{
    touch_start(integer num_detected) {
        list shuffled = llListRandomize(dice, 1);
        llOwnerSay(llList2CSV(shuffled));
    }
}
```

### Stride of 2

```lsl
list list01 = ["Cold", "pizza", "in", "the", "early", "morning"];

list list_random = llListRandomize(list01, 2);
```

With a stride of 2, `list_random` could be any of these permutations:

1. `["Cold", "pizza", "in", "the", "early", "morning"]`
2. `["Cold", "pizza", "early", "morning", "in", "the"]`
3. `["in", "the", "Cold", "pizza", "early", "morning"]`
4. `["in", "the", "early", "morning", "Cold", "pizza"]`
5. `["early", "morning", "Cold", "pizza", "in", "the"]`
6. `["early", "morning", "in", "the", "Cold", "pizza"]`

Notice that two adjacent elements from the original list are always kept together, because the stride of 2 was specified.

### Stride Equals List Length

```lsl
list list_random = llListRandomize(list01, 6);
```

In this case, `list_random` is the original list in its original order, because we told it to keep every set of six elements together, and there are only six elements in the list.

## Notes

- The source list will remain unchanged. A new list is produced and returned. Capture this with a variable unless you are acting directly on the results.
- When you want to randomize the position of every list element, specify a stride of 1.
- If the stride is not a factor of the list length, the source list is returned unchanged. In other words, `llGetListLength(src) % stride` must equal 0.
- Conceptually, the algorithm selects `llGetListLength(src) / stride` buckets, then swaps the contents of buckets with one another.
