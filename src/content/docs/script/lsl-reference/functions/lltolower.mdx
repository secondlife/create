## Caveats

- There is no Linden Library `llToProperCase` function that would return correctly capitalized strings. However, user functions exist that provide this functionality, such as [ToNormal](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/User:Fred_Gandt/Scripts/Functions#ToNormal).
- The function works for many characters outside the 7-bit ASCII range, especially Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek characters, but not all characters tagged as "uppercase" in the Unicode specification are converted.
