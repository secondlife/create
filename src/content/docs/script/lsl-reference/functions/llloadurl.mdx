- This function should not be called from group deeded objects—it will silently fail. (Note: Support for group deeded objects was added in version 1.9 but removed again in the server upgrade of 2007-03-14)
- This function silently fails for an avatar that has muted itself, which can be extremely bewildering to debug since there's no easy way for a user to self-mute

## Important Limitations

- The URL is truncated to 255 characters
- The message text is truncated to 254 characters
- The protocol must be specified and currently only "https://" and "http://" are supported
- The URL should be RFC 1738 compliant with proper escapes

## Examples

```lsl
default
{
    touch_start(integer num_detected)
    {
        key id = llDetectedKey(0);
        string info = "Visit the Second Life website!";

        // must start with either "http://..." or "https://..."
        string url = "http://www.secondlife.com/";

        integer avatarInSameRegion = (llGetAgentSize(id) != ZERO_VECTOR); // TRUE or FALSE

        if (avatarInSameRegion)
        {
            llLoadURL(id, info, url);
        }
        else
        {
            // if the agent is not in the same region, send a message instead
            // the viewer will turn the URL clickable
            llInstantMessage(id, info + " " + url);
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates:
- Detecting which avatar touched the object
- Checking if the avatar is in the same region (important for llLoadURL to work)
- Falling back to llInstantMessage if the avatar is in a different region (the viewer will automatically make the URL clickable)

## Version History

- Introduced in version 1.6 with no support for group deeded objects
- Version 1.9: Support for group deeded objects was added (possibly by accident)
- Server upgrade 2007-03-14: Support for group deeded objects was removed
