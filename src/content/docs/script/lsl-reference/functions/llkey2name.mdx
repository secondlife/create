## Caveats

- It is difficult to tell the difference between a prim that has a name that is an empty string and a prim that is not in the sim, or because an invalid key was specified. Use `llGetObjectDetails` to avoid this problem.
- To get around the "avatar must be present" limitation, you can use the `llRequestAgentData` function and the `dataserver` event to obtain the avatar's name from a key.
- If an avatar is "ghosted" (which occasionally happens due to a longstanding server bug), an empty string is returned even though the avatar is seemingly present and shows up in `llSensor` and the Mini-Map. This fact can be used as the basis of a Ghost Detector script.
- Unlike the related functions `llGetUsername` and `llRequestUsername`, this function returns a 'nice' name in proper case and - if applicable - with a space, e.g. "Peter Stindberg", instead of "peter.stindberg" (or "Josh" instead of "josh.resident") as returned by the other two functions.

## Notes

- This function must specify a valid rezzed prim or avatar key, present in or otherwise known to the sim in which the script is running. If not, an empty string is returned.
- In the case of an avatar, this function will still return a valid name if the avatar is a child agent of the sim (i.e., in an adjacent sim, but presently able to see into the one the script is in), or for a short period after the avatar leaves the sim (specifically, when the client completely disconnects from the sim, either as a main or child agent).
- Keys of inventory items will not work; use `llGetInventoryName` instead.
- This function returns the legacy name of the prim or avatar specified by the key.
