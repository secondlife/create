title: llSetVelocity
description: >-
  If the object is physics-enabled, sets the object's linear velocity to
  Velocity.

  If Local==TRUE, Velocity is treated as a local directional vector; otherwise,
  Velocity is treated as a global directional vector.

- Provides instantaneous velocity not dependent on object energy or mass
- Only works with physics-enabled objects
- Use `local=TRUE` for local directional vectors (relative to object rotation)
- Use `local=FALSE` for regional directional vectors (absolute directions)
