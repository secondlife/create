### Stop Filtering

```lsl
llCollisionFilter("", NULL_KEY, TRUE);
```

### Filter Out All Collisions

```lsl
llCollisionFilter("", NULL_KEY, FALSE);
```

### Detect Collisions with Specific Objects

This script, placed in a wearable object, detects a collision when the person wearing it collides with an object named "Post":

- **1st instance:** An object named "Post" has several child prims named "Object". The prim named "Post" hits the scripted object or scripted prim - the collision will be detected
- **2nd instance:** An object named "Post" has several child prims named "Object". A child prim named "Object" hits the scripted object or scripted prim - the collision will be detected
- **3rd instance:** An object named "Object" has several child prims named "Post". A prim named "Post" hits the scripted object or scripted prim - the collision will NOT be detected

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llCollisionFilter("Post", "", TRUE);
    }

    collision_start(integer total_number)
    {
        llSay(0, "OUCH!");
    }
}
```

## Caveats

- Any call of `llCollisionFilter` in the same event as `llVolumeDetect` changing (not just being called, but actually moving from FALSE to TRUE or vice versa) will be disregarded (before or after), **if** the event handler previously called a user-defined function. See SVC-2490.
  - You can work around this by calling them in separate events, such as `touch_start` and `touch_end`.
- Damage caused by `llSetDamage` will still apply to a filtered avatar.
  - Consequently, the object will immediately die on collision with the avatar (and kill the avatar if their health reaches 0).
