title: STATUS_ROTATE_Z
description: "Controls/indicates whether the object can physically rotate around\n\t\t\tthe specific axis or not. This flag has no meaning\n\t\t\tfor non-physical objects. Set the value to FALSE\n\t\t\tif you want to disable rotation around that axis. The\n\t\t\tdefault is TRUE for a physical object.\n\t\t\tA useful example to think about when visualizing\n\t\t\tthe effect is a sit-and-spin device. They spin around the\n\t\t\tZ axis (up) but not around the X or Y axis."
