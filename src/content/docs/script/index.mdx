Welcome to scripting in Second Life! Whether you're new to programming or an experienced developer, you'll find the tools and resources you need to bring your creations to life.

## Choose Your Language

Second Life supports two scripting languages:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="SLua (Second Life + Luau)" icon="rocket">
    A modern scripting option based on Luau (A Lua variant). SLua brings contemporary language features to Second Life scripting.

    - Modern language features (maps, types, objects)
    - Familiar to millions of Luau/Lua developers
    - Active development and improvements
    - Better performance
  </Card>

  <Card title="LSL (Linden Scripting Language)" icon="pencil">
    The classic scripting language for Second Life. LSL has been the foundation of scripted content since 2003, with a vast library of existing scripts and tutorials.

    - Extensive existing examples 
    - Large community of scripters
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## What Can You Script?

Scripts control nearly every aspect of interactive content in Second Life:

- **Objects and Prims** - Make objects move, change color, respond to touch
- **Avatars** - Create attachments, HUDs, gestures, and animations
- **Environment** - Control lighting, sound, and particles
- **Communication** - Chat, instant messages, HTTP requests, and data storage
- **Physics** - Apply forces, detect collisions, and simulate real-world behavior
