SLua brings modern scripting to Second Life using Luau, a high-performance typed variant of Lua developed by Roblox. If you're familiar with Lua, Python, JavaScript, or other modern languages, you'll feel right at home.

## Why SLua?

SLua offers several advantages for Second Life scripting:

- **Modern Language Features** - coroutines, optional typing, objects, and more
- **Better Performance** - Optimized runtime for complex operations
- **Familiar Syntax** - If you know Lua, Python, or JavaScript, you're already halfway there
- **Type Safety** - Optional type annotations catch errors before runtime
- **Active Development** - Regular improvements and new features

## Coming from LSL?

If you're already familiar with LSL, SLua will feel familiar but more powerful. Here's a quick comparison:

<CodeComparison>
  <Fragment slot="lsl">
  ```lsl
  integer gIsRed = TRUE;

  default {
    touch_start(integer total_number) {
      llSay(0, "Changing color!");
      
      if (gIsRed) {
        llSetColor(<0.0, 1.0, 0.0>, ALL_SIDES);
      } else {
        llSetColor(<1.0, 0.0, 0.0>, ALL_SIDES);
      }
      
      gIsRed = !gIsRed;  // Toggle state
    }
  }
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="slua">
  ```luau
  local isRed: boolean = true

  function LLEvents.touch_start(detected: {DetectedEvent})
      ll.Say(0, "Changing color!")

      if isRed then
          ll.SetColor(vector(0.0, 1.0, 0.0), ALL_SIDES)
      else
          ll.SetColor(vector(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), ALL_SIDES)
      end

      isRed = not isRed  -- Toggle state
  end
  ```
  </Fragment>
</CodeComparison>

## What You'll Learn

## Quick Start

Let's write your first SLua script. This simple script makes an object say "Hello!" when touched:

```luau
-- Listen for touch events
function LLEvents.touch_start(detected: {DetectedEvent})
  -- Say hello in local chat
  ll.Say(0, "Hello, Avatar!")
end
```

That's it! Save this script in a prim and touch it to see it work.

## Learning Path

Here's the recommended path through the SLua documentation:

1. **[Language Fundamentals](/script/learn/slua/fundamentals/)** - (HELP WANTED) Start here if you're new to SLua or Lua
2. **[From LSL to SLua](./from-lsl/)** - Converting your LSL knowledge to SLua
3. **[Events and Handlers](./events/)** - (HELP WANTED) How to respond to world events
4. **[Async Programming](./async/)** - (HELP WANTED) Writing asynchronous code with coroutines
5. **[Working with Types](./types/)** - (HELP WANTED) Using SLua's optional type system
6. **[Standard Library](./library/)** - (HELP WANTED) Complete reference of available functions
